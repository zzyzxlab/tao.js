new way of developing software with a few simple goals (more in the Intro: Motivations & Goals)\n\nUse a simplified language that elicits communication between Engineers and Product Managers\nLeverage that language to build the software\nBuild software with the intent that it will evolve\n\nWhat is tao.js?\nLiterally at the core, @tao.js/core is a simple package to use in any App we build to\ncreate Reactive Apps that espouse the principles outlined in the Reactive Manifesto\nby implementing what's called the TAO Programming Model in JavaScript.\nThe whole thing is designed around generating 3-Dimensional Events in the form of a tuple\nwith a specific shape that follows the acronym from its namesake (T.A.O.):\nTerm - the thing in the context - conceptually usually but not limited to a domain entity or relationship between entitiesAction - the operation being performed on the thing in the contextOrient(ation) - the perspective of the interaction with the system at\nthe moment of this operation on this thing\nThese are called trigrams describing specific tuples with this \nspecific shape and appearing in this order.\nExamples are:\n\n{App,Enter,Admin}\n{User,Track,Portal}\n{Project,Create,Portal}\n{Task,Store,Reporting}\n\nThese Events or Messages are defined in this way to be flexible enough to capture any\nApplication Context that can occur in any App while being closed enough so as not to\nbe infinitely diverse.\nFrom there, we use the TAO export of the package to add our listeners, known as\nhandlers in tao.js, like this:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\n// add a handler\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'Kids', a: 'Enter', o: 'Camp' }, (tao, data) => {\n  // handler implements a reaction to the specific AppCon (Event)\n  // - excerpted from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub7MkK-a0hU\n  alert(`Hi, kids! Welcome to Camp Krusty……I'll see you in a few weeks.\n  Until then I've turned things over to my bestest buddy in the whole wide world,\n  ${data.Camp.director}. I want you to treat ${data.Camp.director} with the same\n  respect you would treat me. Now here's ${data.Camp.director}`);\n});\n\n// set the AppCon passing relevant data\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Kids', a: 'Enter', o: 'Camp' }, {\n  Camp: { name: 'Camp Krusty', director: 'Mr. Black' }\n});\n\nSo there you have it.  On the surface it's very simple and easy to use.  Add handlers for\nApplication Contexts (AppCons) in the form of trigrams and JavaScript functions with\n2 arguments (the trigram as tao and the particular data for this occurrence).  Next we\nset those Application Contexts at the right time in the App to create the reactions.\nWith this simplicity comes a lot of power in the form of creating Apps that are:\n\ndecoupled\nflexible\ndesigned to easily evolve\neasy to integrate\nhorizontally scalable\ncommon Event-driven system across client & server\ncommon Message format for all environments\n\nGive it a try and then read the guide that follows to learn more about all of the various\ncapabilities you get by the way the library was defined.\nThere's more\ntao.js encompasses a full JavaScript library of packages built to implement the TAO in\nJavaScript including making it easy to integrate with other popular JavaScript frameworks\nfor building Apps.\nAll packages are published under the @tao.js namespace and available from the\nmonorepo on Github.\nCurrently there are packages to integrate with:\n\nReact.js - @tao.js/react\nSocket.io - @tao.js/socket.io\nand more to come…\n\nTell me more about this TAO thingy\nThe TAO is a programming paradigm designed around splitting up any System or Application\ninto very granular constituent parts organized to respond to a common message format,\na 3-dimensional tuple (trigram) with a very specific set of 3 attributes that\ncan be used to describe any context which can occur within the System or Application\n(known here as Application Context).\nDescribing a System or Application as a Set of trigrams has the specific intent of making\nit easy to communicate in non-technical terms what the software should or intends to do.\nOnce the software has been sufficiently decomposed in this way, it is reconstituted thru\ngenerating and passing these messages to functions known as handlers that perform the\nvalue added activities of the program.\nThis is done using a Signal Network provided as part of the TAO Implementation which manages\nmarshalling these messages to handlers.  Leveraging the handler as the unit of execution allows the\nsoftware built to run in any execution environment.\nPower of a Common Form of Event & Message\nBy making all events and messages follow a common format, there is no longer any need\nto negotiate particular interfaces between the various layers or parts of a System or\nApplication, thus making it a simplified programming paradigm to accept and encourage\nbest practices in building software.\nThe downstream beauty of this is the meta-data provided by all of these Events is easy\nto siphon off to reporting and any other use for the data without additional effort\nin the generation.\nWhere to go Next\nTake a look at the following resources to become more familiar with the TAO and tao.js:\n\nAn Origin Story is a great place to understand how we evolved our thinking to create the TAO Programming Model\nIntroduction section has a lot of introductory material to help you get up to speed depending on where you're coming from and why it's useful\nBasics will get you started on how to implement using the tao.js libraries\n\n"},"story/":{"url":"story/","title":"An Origin Story","keywords":"","body":"An Origin Story for the TAO Programming Model\nSometimes and for some people it is important to understand a bit of history in how a thing\ncame about in order to grok the thing or fully grasp the implications of it, and why it is a\nnatural and useful progression of things we already do.\nFor this reason, I'm providing a narrative walk through that illustrates how we evolve to the\nTAO Programming Model.  While drawing on my experience in conceiving it, a complete\nhistorical reference would not offer the intended outcome of helping to explain the TAO\nProgramming Model's value and place without meandering too much through various additional\nexplanations.  This I fear would further muddy the waters of what I've found to already be a\ndifficult topic for many to grasp.\nIn lieu of this full historical reference (which I may produce at some point for my own sanity),\nI will walk you as the reader through the genesis of the TAO Programming Model in the same\npath that I used to get to it in the hopes that it will inspire your understanding for why it\nis so valuable to building data-driven applications, which represent the majority of\napplication development today.\nWe first start with a description of a Problem similar to what I found myself in at\na previous company many years ago working on a rebuild of an existing application.\nWithin that problem, we had a set of Requirements to solve for.  Some of these were\nexplicit and some were implicit.\nDuring the phase of the project when we were attempting to design the solution, I was able to\ncrystalize concepts that I had carried with me for some time:that Apps are Data, which directed me on how best to describe our solution space to my\nteam using a 3-Dimensional Matrix.\nEventually I came to realize that what was best for our own situation was to Design the App as a Platform from the start.\nThe beauty of this thinking was that I had wanted to make the Platform very simplistic and easy\nto integrate with by focusing on what I called the Application Context as the\nextension point.\nThis allowed for an architecture that was Reactive from the beginning with the\nflexibility necessary to fit all of the desired usage scenarios.\nWhat I eventually found was it created a new way to think about building software with the End Result\nbeing the TAO Programming Model, a general solution for any data-driven application without the\nlock-in found in all other opinionated frameworks.\n"},"story/problem.html":{"url":"story/problem.html","title":"The Problem","keywords":"","body":"The Problem\nLet's imagine you've joined our company.  This company started out building creation tools\ncentered around video content. Over time and at the behest of customers, they built an\napplication that allowed for the management of the content created by the authoring tools,\nwhich included:\n\na Portal for easy consumption and tracking of viewership\nan Admin for managing the content and users within the system\nand a set of Reports mostly tied to the Admin itself\n\nIt was a pretty standard story of building it specifically for a large client based on their\nspecific requirements and then marshalling it into a more generalized application so it could be\nsold and resold to many other clients.\nThis is about when you joined the company, but after about a year and a half, the product needed\nan overhaul to remain competitive, especially for the money being charged.\nTechnical Debt\nThe product itself had plenty of technical debt stemming from multiple factors:\nOutdated Technology\nStarting with outdated technology when it was first built because that's what the first developer\nknew how to use, the technology in the existing version is at best 5 years old now at this point.\nThis gives us several issues:\n\nreuse within the application is harder, and reuse with other products is impossible\nhaving to hire developers to work on old technology\nmaintaining the code base requires specialized expertise that is not being taught or learned\n\nTechnical Decisions\nStop me if you've heard this one before, but the original application that was built for our\nlarge customer was built by a single developer under a strict deadline with direct\nguidance from an eccentric customer.  The developer with a background in small business website consulting\nwas also equally as eccentric, and this was the most complex project he'd ever taken on.  Lacking\nthe experience of working with others on a code base nor having to maintain his own work for any serious duration, this\nproject became a playground for testing new patterns he would come up with on the spot.\nSide note: this is not a knock on the developer who did the work.  He built what he thought best\nat the time of building under the guidance and oversight of those in charge.  I bring it up in\nthis way because I've seen this pattern of behavior in start ups so often and it's useful to\nunderstand how we got to where we are to illustrate the point for this story.  In the end, if a product is built and makes money and allows\nthe start up to grow, then it's done it's job.  With my experience and the lessons coming, I'm\ngoing to show a better way to get there.\nLacking a cohesive set of patterns for developing the application, when it came time to repurpose\nit for general use, much of the functionality was bespoke for the initial client and coupled to\nthe client's specific desired workflow so it couldn't be ported over.  Unfortunately, instead the\ndesign patterns used were ported over for the sake of \"expediency.\"  It's funny how often\nexpediency is used as an excuse to save a week or two for software that will be either sold to\nother people or in execution for years to come.  When other developers picked up work on the\napplication, they could only copy the patterns already in place in order to \"make it work.\"\nThese early technical decisions are so prevalent in the product that they made it almost\nimpossible to refactor anything because everything represented a \"large change.\"  One good\nexample is how navigation and the menu system work.  This was most visible to our\ncustomers where one of the top-level menu items called \"Management\" has 70% of the functionality\nin the Admin UI, leaving a very unbalanced information architecture that we receive a lot of\ncomplaints about.\nThis first developer of the application is no longer with the company, having only overlapped your\ntime by only one month.\nFrankenstein Technology\nI'm sure you've experienced this hack before.\nIn order to build new reports for an SOW with a bell cow customer in the Pharmaceutical industry\nthat would be used to provide recommendations to future customers, we even stood up a new server\nto use newer technology and embed it within an iframe to make it seem like part of the\napplication.  While it allowed the reports to be easier to build, it messed with the navigation,\nfurther complicating the UX for customers.\nDifferent Customers\nThe original solution was built with an Enterprise Customer wishing to serve thousands for live\nor pre-taped events across the company's global network and requiring that it be self-hosted\ninside their network.  While this is still a large portion of the target customers having deep\npockets, we started selling to other types of customers with different usage scenarios:\n\nUniversities for online replay of lectures and course materials\nUniversities and Schools offering Compliance education\nLarge Government organizations with strict regulation constraints\nHealth Providers with strict HIPAA regulation requirements\n\nUpgrading\nThe existing Media Management application has a difficult upgrade path, requiring downtime\nwhenever there is a change to the database and strict reliance on outdated DLLs on the server.\nMoving Forward\nBased on these factors, it is definitely time to go with a rebuild using latest technologies,\ncurrent well-known design patterns, and allow the current team to own the codebase.\nAs someone who has spent time maintaining and adding new features to the existing application,\nyou realize what is best for the new build is to not try to build everything into a single\nmonolith up front but to split it up into 3 distinct applications depending on how it will be\nused:\n\nPortal interface for consumers of the content\nAdministrative interface for content creators and organizers\nReporting interface for report consumers\n\nThe team agrees with your assessment and it is decided to build 3 separate applications to handle\nthese 3 general uses rather than attempt to build them all into a single application.\nWhich lead us to defining our Requirements.\n"},"story/reqs.html":{"url":"story/reqs.html","title":"Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Requirements for the New Build\nWith our background problem, we have set the stage for the requirements of our new\nbuild.\nOur requirements come in 3 different flavors for this new build.  When taking on a new build such\nas this, the feature requirements are usually the easiest part to gather, since at a minimum, if\nthe application is to deliver what customers can receive from the current version, then it must\nas a base line deliver the same set of features as the existing version.\nWhat is more important to focus on with a new build is what will be gained with the new build\nfrom scratch of the application or product?\nFeature Requirements\nThe new build of our Media Management application needs to include the features of the existing\napplication with a richer set of capabilities and deeper integration into the content creation\ntools in order to realize the potential of the Media Management application that it currently is\nunable to do in the existing product.\nRicher capabilities were sought around the management of:\n\nContent Creation & Lifecycle\nContent Organization\nUser Management and Permissions\nReports\nNotifications and Alerts\n\nAdditionally, deeper integration with the content creation tools allowing:\n\nAutomation of a publishing pipeline\nControl over content creation tools permissions\nRemote control of capturing tools\n\nFinally, better integration with products that are already being integrated with our solutions\nthrough Value Added Resellers (VAR):\n\nCisco Routers\nCDNs (like Akamai and AWS Cloudfront)\nCrestron Room Controls\nBlackboard\n\nPackaging Requirements\nThe existing Media Management application is a client-server based application that was installed\non a client's own hardware because that was a requirement of the first few iterations of the\nproduct.  Now that we're in a new build scenario, we want to be able to offer it as a self-hosted\ninstall or a SaaS product with multi-tenancy capability.\nBeyond the set of Feature Requirements described above, it would be\nadvantageous to factor in the different usage scenarios and provide differing solutions to our\ngrowing list of differing customers.\nTreating the Media Management application like a Product Line with different solution packages\nand modules available to add onto or package together to meet the different needs\nwill allow our sales team an easier path to convincing the customer to buy with prequalification\ntowards one of our package offerings.  It would also allow the product and engineering teams the\nability to match solutions to customer demands, divide labor by them and provide an easier path\nto upgrade and maintenance scenarios.\nServing the needs of a Fortune 100 enterprise with 200,000 employees spread across the globe for\ninternal CEO communications and corporate content differ from a University using it for\ndistribution of course lectures and materials through an integration with Blackboard.\nAdditionally, a lower end version without all of the bells and whistles of real-time event\ntracking and course management would allow the establishment of a beachhead in customers with\nsmaller budgets or hesitent to commit as well as establish the company as a leader in the space\ninstead of giving that market to cheaper solutions to use with our content creation tools.\nFor that reason, you advocated for the building out of different customer-centric versions that\nwould be packaged by layering sets of features as modules on top of a simplistic base\napplication, e.g.:\n\nBase Media Management application - content and organization, basic users and organization\nEducation - integration with Blackboard, organization templated around needs of courses\nEnterprise - integration with Cisco Routers and tigher integration with content creation tools, real-time tracking, LDAP-enabled user management\n\nAPI Requirements\nThe existing Media Management application was not built to be API-driven.  Rather it was\noriginally built as a server-rendered client-server web application.  With the new build we want\nto take advantage of all of the advances in building Single-Page Apps (SPAs) and an API-driven\napproach.\nThe majority of our sales are through our Channel partnerships with Value Added Resellers (VARs).\nWhat they were looking for more than anything are products that can meet the needs of their\nclients that also provide them with additional space to add value by building integrations for\nwhich they can charge for their services.\nTo provide this, our new build should have a rich API for extending functionality to\nintegrations beyond those we can build out of the box.  The needs of having an API as a\nrequirement weren't part of the existing Media Management application but were long sought for\nby our VAR partners, so they must be included in the new build.\nMoving to Solution Designs\nAs your team asks for help in how to tackle designing the solution, it occurs to you that a\npreviously unrelated realization, that Apps are Data would help you help them.\n"},"story/data.html":{"url":"story/data.html","title":"Apps are Data","keywords":"","body":"Apps are Data\nAt this point in your career, you're not new to building applications from scratch nor\narchitecting full applications for others.\nIn that time, you have dealt with the trials and tribulations at a granular level of having to\nstore data in a normalized way to make it easy to manage while also serve it up to users quickly\nand report on it with relatively low latencies to provide a good user experience.\nData Model Fail\nWe've all experienced a time when our primary data model failed.\nReporting Fail\nIn the life of an application that has any success, the one thing that is neglected at the\nbeginning is always reporting.  The\n\nwe'll figure it out later … let's just prove someone wants this first\n\nusually drives that decision.  Then later comes and the business is asking;\n\nwhat's going on with our application?how can I tell how successful we are?\n\nUnfortunately, that second question is never phrased that way.  It's usually asked of the team\nin a way that it's not even clear that's the goal behind the question, or the question behind the\n5 questions it took to get them to the question they finally asked, such as:\n\nhow many pieces of content have been uploaded in the last month by user, and what is the\nviewership of each video broken down by how long each user watched the video?\n\nThe first attempt of most teams is to try aggregating that data on the fly to build the\nreport.  With any normalized data set, this would be a mistake, leading to a report page that\nwould take minutes to complete if it completed at all.\nThis works when the data set is small, but systems reach a tipping point at which they fall over.\nPage Load Fail\nAnother failure of our pristinely normalized data model that comes along often is when there are\ntoo many joins to render a popular page.  This happens with any B2C product that hits a popularity\ncurve and traffic explodes.\nOur normalized model is failing to service the most used aspect of our application, that\nused by the consumers of the application in order to easier to manage the data in the back end.\nSolving Data Model Problems\nDenormalizing the Model for Reporting\nThe next step teams take is to break out of the normalized model to fix reporting by introducing\na denormalized\nmodel into their primary database.  In order to populate those tables that are used to drive\nreports, batch jobs are created to aggregate the data at set intervals controlled by cron job\noperators.\nThese work for a time, until they don't or they become too many to manage effectively.\nNext comes the request to have real-time counts on active viewers of videos at any given moment\nwith knowing which video they're watching, how far into the video they are, and all the metadata\nsurrounding the user and the video so that it can be \"sliced and diced\" (that is a massively\noverplayed idiom) when someone is viewing the report.  At that point we know our batch cron jobs\nto denormalized SQL tables inside of our primary database will no longer hold up.  Or we witness\nthis fact when we try to build it that way.\nIn fact, this is one of the things that led to the explosion of NoSQL databases at the midpoint\nof the first decade of the 21st century when technology companies reached Internet-scale rather\nquickly, experiencing growth curves in their data sets that had not been previously seen.\nMulti-Model Approach for Page Loads\nThe general way we solve this is by using a Cache.  Using a Page Cache like Varnish is one\nsolution that stands between our server and the client.  However, with the advent of SPAs and\nAPI-driven applications, most often we use some sort of Object Cache in the form of a Key-Value\nstore like memcache or Redis to store our denormalized and hydrated objects accessible with a\nspecific key, usually the identity of the primary entity in the database.\nThis works well for the most part but has some drawbacks.  If we have different pages that utilize\ndifferent parts of our fully hydrated entities, then we either store a lot of objects specifically\ndesigned for each page or we cache a god-object with everything every page needs.\nPerspectives on Data\nWhy the discussion about failed database design?  Because it is through these failures that we\nlearned important lessons about how we treat our data.  While I was able to understand early on\nthat every\napplication is a set of Data and the combined set of manipulations on that data, I was married to\nthe idea of getting the \"source of truth\" correct for the data.  It turns out the Application is the source of\ntruth for the data, and the Application may require various perspectives on that data.\nWe use OLTP databases to keep track of our transactional data, and OLAP databases to report on our\ndata.  It's the same data but with different perpspectives applied.\nAt the time I went through this process, the NoSQL movement was beginning to take hold.  I began to understand\nthat not only did it make sense to have different databases for transactions and reporting,\ndepending on the need, our application might have several different perspectives on the same data,\nand store them differently in order to provide the best user and developer experience.\nWe normalize data for managing it.  We cache denormalized versions of our data for quick reads in\norder to consume it.\nWe denormalize and track the same data as it changes into Star and Snowflake schemas to make ad-hoc reporting fast and accurate in time.  All of this is ok,\nand it's expected if you're doing it right.\nThe most valuable lesson from the NoSQL movement\nis that we should expect to have various different data stores that will model the data specifically\nfor the given use (or perspective) which is most advantaged.  There is room in many applications\nthat have enough sophistication and age for a Relational Database, a Document Store, a Key-Value\nStore, Time Series and possibly a Graph Database.  We rarely perform search against our Relational Database anymore, offloading that to Elasticsearch.\nEffect on the Project\nRecognition and acceptance of a multi-store data model is an important breakthrough in our\nthinking, although your team hasn't come to that conclusion yet.\nThe evolution of that conversation will come during your conversations about Building a Matrix\nto capture the breadth of requirements and solution designs.\n"},"story/matrix.html":{"url":"story/matrix.html","title":"Building a Matrix","keywords":"","body":"Building a Matrix\nYour team is well aware of the Feature Requirements and\nthe API Requirements plus the direction to\nbuild separate applications for the major usage scenarios.

I was tasked with building a server that could\ntake customer applications for auto loans and submit them to multiple different providers that\nhad web services allowing electronic auto loan submissions for used car loans.  Fairly new to\nprofessional software development, my team recently lost our only other developer in the CTO who was fired when the CEO\nfound out he was running a complete mirror of our site as a competitor.  His replacement was a\nfriend of the CEO brought in to just keep the lights on so to speak, so I didn't have much\nguidance in the way of building software like this.  Like a good overthinking and overanalyzing\njunior developer, I came up with 4 different designs for the server.  Without anywhere to turn\nfor advice on how to tell what is a good design, I reached out to my friend Google with:\n\nhow can I determine a good software design\n\nor some such phrase.  Up kept coming links to the GoF Design Patterns\nbook.  I decided I should probably read it and bought it on Amazon.  This led me on a journey\ntowards consuming every \"patterns\" book or material I could find for the next 5 years, and it was the perfect time for it.  Early 2000 saw an explosion of \"patterns\" material in software development, especially in the Java community.  When I went back to USC, I was popularizing patterns with my classmates and professors, and using many of the patterns I learned during my course work there.\nSo when I saw another \"patterns\" book at the USC Bookstore just before graduating, I\nsnatched it up as another must read.  It's a little known book (only 7 reviews on Amazon) called\nA Requirements Pattern\nby Patricia Ferdinand.  I read it while I was still at Countrywide several years before our Media\nManagement new build effort.\nIn her book, Patricia laid out a 3-dimensional matrix for gathering requirements for software.\nThe purpose of this is to include all perspectives in order to eliminate gaps that can occur\nwhen gathering requirements.\nHere's the visual representation of her method that always sticks out in my head, especially at\nthe time we were doing this (forgive me but I can't find a digital copy of the book):\n\n3-Dimensions\nPerspective again!  Perspective is so important for so many things.\nIt dawns on you that what the team needed was a simplified way of generating a list of the\nscreens they would need to design.  What they were lacking was the direction on how\nto do that.\nSo you take the team through a brainstorming exercise to determine the different\nitems in your Domain Model.  From your understanding of the Domain Model, and having built data-centric\napplications many times over, you know the application has to provide CRUD manipulations.  So you take those two dimensions (Entities & Operations) and\nadd the third for Perspective.\nWhat results is giving the team an Excel sheet that looks similar to this:\n\n\n\nEntity\nC\nR\nU\nD\nPerspective\n\n\n\n\nContent\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\nUser\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\nFolder\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\nHow you direct them to use it is …\n\n… for every Entity we have for the system, they need to think about and design …\n… how each of the basic CRUD operations would occur …\n… from each of the different perspectives\n\nNot every entity will have every operation from every perspective, but the matrix would ensure\nthey're not missing anything.  Additionally, anything missing would be explicit so it would be\nknown to be a decision rather than an ommission.\nSolving More Problems\nAs you continue this exercise, it seems to you this could be a way to solve more problems\nthan just ours, as well as a way to easily Design Apps as a Platform, but there's\nmore to do.\n"},"story/platform.html":{"url":"story/platform.html","title":"Designing the App as a Platform","keywords":"","body":"Designing the App as a Platform\nIn order to meet the Packaging Requirements, you need to rethink\nhow we not only deliver the product as a Product Line with various configurations  rather than a\nsingle standalone Product, you need to\nconsider how the product itself is built.  Additionally, to provide the right type of API Requirements\nthat will meet the needs of our VAR Partners, just providing a REST API isn't good enough as\nour Partners are looking for ways to embed functionality from other products into our Media\nManagement products.\nBased on these requirements, to offer the desired flexibility in our first roll out as well as\nprovide future flexibility in the form of Features & Modules, you concluded it makes sense to\narchitect our new build as a Platform.  But what's the right way to do that?\nArchitecting the New Build\nIt's important that we need to see our application as a Platform instead of just a standalone\nApplication in order to meet the Packaging Requirements.  A Platform that has hooks for adding Features and Modules from Integrators and\nModule builders.  If we see it in this way then naturally what if we take it further and look\nat it as a Platform on which we build our own Features and Modules, acting like Integrators and\nModule builders.\nNormally, for a product that is a first build and has some uncertainty around customers and market\nfit, it would be crazy to consider building it as a platform, unless that is the product itself.\nI will demonstrate later that this isn't the case, but in the normal course of building applications, this would be prudent.\nHowever, when we have a proven product, that is several years old and demonstrating value in the market to the point there is high demand, and it is undergoing a rewrite due to Technical Debt.  In this case, when the desire is to ultimately provide a platform that\nwould itself unlock a lot of potential value to not only our company, but to the Integrators we\nrely on for the bulk of our sales, then starting the new build as a Platform is a more prudent\noption from the start.\nIn deciding to move forward with a Platform Architecture, you determine that the first Integrators\nwill be our team, and we will build up the functionality of our Product Line on top of a basic\nPlatform.  But what is that basic Platform?  Where do we start with that?\nPlatform Extension\nWhen desiging a Platform for software, the most important decision up front is what are the points\nof extension that will be used by developers to add functionality to the Platform.\nCan we build upon our 3-Dimensional Matrix to become our extensions points?I thought you'd never ask.\nRelationships\nWhat's missing from our current Matrix Model?Because they can have an important life of their own, separate business logic as well as a level\nimportance to building Features and Modules, we're currently not accounting for Relationships between\nEntities, such as User-Content, User-Folder or Folder-Content relationships, in our current Matrix.\nA simple fix is to elevate Relationships to be first-class like an Entity is within our model.\nSo now our example matrix is something like this:\n\n\n\nTerm\nC\nR\nU\nD\nPerspective\n\n\n\n\nContent\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\nUser\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\nUser-Content\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\nFolder\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\nFolder-Content\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\nUser-Folder\n\n\n\n\nPortal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport\n\n\n…\n\n\n\n\n…\n\n\n\nNow we are covering anything that our data store would need to keep track of and surfacing it to\nour design via the Matrix Model.\nPerspectives\nOur Perspective s capture how we may store the data in different ways depending upon how\nit will be used, e.g. a very normalized version in our Admin database vs a denormalized version in\nour Portal's data store designed for handling high read throughput.  Our Perspective also provides\na bit more:\n\nwe can split up our Modules to only listen for the Perspective they care about\nwe can split up the logic used to manipulate the data between Perspectives\n\nAn example of #2 from above would be that when a piece of Content is Created via the Admin,\nits denormalized version will need to be Created in the Portal database.  If our Content\nModule can have some sort of trigger when this occurs to execute the Portal logic after the\nAdmin logic succeeds without the Admin logic being aware of it, then we've successfully\ndecoupled the two through a useful extension point.\nThus, we now have an extension point mechanism we can use throughout the Platform.\nExtending Functionality through Features\nNow that we have a successful model of our Extension Points for the Platform, how do we want to go\nabout adding Features to the Platform?  Like, how would a developer add a Feature or Module to the\nPlatorm itself?\nIs it possible to use our Extension Point model for this, too?\nWhat if we used Feature itself as a Term?\nIndividual Features can be created, read (loaded), updated (upgraded), and deleted (removed) from\nthe Platform just like any other Entity.  And as a Platform, it would need to keep track of\nthese in the same way as any other data in order to surface them correctly.\nAdditionally, the relationship between Features and other Entities would be important in\ndetermining:\n\nwhich Users can access a Feature?\nwhich Content does a Feature apply to?\n\nSo if our Extension Point mechanism is also the same mechanism by which a Feature is added,\nloaded, and manipulated within the Platform, then we're truly on our way to a nice elegant design.\nMoving Beyond CRUD\nNext we'll see how moving beyond basic CRUD operations will allow us to understand our\napplications built using the Platform as a series of Application Contexts.\n"},"story/appcons.html":{"url":"story/appcons.html","title":"Application Context","keywords":"","body":"Application Context\nWhat we've created is a description of an Application Context in the form of a 3-dimensional\ntuple also known as a trigram.  We want to use that trigram as the basis for extending the\nfunctionality of our Platform, by:\n\nBuilding the base set of Features to the Platform to produce a Product Line\nOpening up the Extension mechanism to our Partners and Integrators to build on top of the Platform and enhance our Products\n\nModifying our Matrix\nWhile the Matrix Model is working thus far, you're sure there are some changes you can make to\nimprove upon the initial design.\nActions\nWhile CRUD has dominated your career in building data-centric applications, you've also worked\nwithin Frameworks where the basics of CRUD operations was a limiting factor.  You've somewhat\nsolved for this in your new model by treating Relationships as first-class citizens, and with the\nintroduction of Perspectives allowing you to target different views and formats of Entities and\nRelationships within the Platform's Matrix Model.  But it's not enough to overcome the following\nquestions that still plague dealing with basic CRUD operations as the distinct set of operations,\nsuch as:\n\nwhere does search fit in the standard Read operation?\ndoes Read pertain to both fetching a single Entity as well as a list of Entities?\nare all Updates the same?\nis a Soft Delete an Update or a Delete?\nis a CRUD operation really the same thing at every point in an Application, from Client to API to database?\n\nThese and other questions, along with fights you've had with several ORM-based rapid development\nframeworks to build features beyond basic CRUD functions help you realize and decide that you\nneed to move beyond a simplistic set of operations to allow for a more flexible way of looking at\nwhat developers need in order to operate on Entities and Relationships from any different\nPerspective.\nSo you change the Matrix Model to be more flexible using Action to capture what is happening to\nan Entity or a Relationship at any given time.  Moving beyond CRUD to have a descriptive set of Actions that pertain to the Application being built allows those Actions to communicate more to\ndevelopers and integrators.\nOrientation\nYou've been using Perspective to refer to our 3rd dimension in the Matrix Model.  While this is a\ntruly unique breakthrough, is it reflective of where we're going with this new Model?\nPerspective is focused on the point of view of the Observer of activity.  While this was\ninitially useful to get us here, you realize it's not exactly emulating what you're trying to\ncreate with the model.  It occurs to you that if we're going to define an Application Context not\nnecessarily by what is perceived to be happening, but as the occurrence of something happening in\na given direction, then our 3rd dimension should be from the poitn of view of the Actor of the\ninteraction rather than the Observer.\nOrientation captures this concept better as an Action will be Oriented in a direction.\nUpdated Matrix\nOur new Matrix is updated to now be:\n\n\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient(ation)\n\n\n\n\nContent\nCreate\nAdmin\n\n\n\nList\n\"\n\n\n\nRetrieve\n\"\n\n\n\nFind\n\"\n\n\n\nList\nPortal\n\n\n\nSelect\n\"\n\n\n\nView\n\"\n\n\n\nWatch\n\"\n\n\n\nWatch\nReport\n\n\nUser-Content\nList\nPortal\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\nState Machine\nAnother bit of knowledge gained from your experience that you're now building upon is the concept\nthat all Applications represent some type of State Machine, with some more complex than others.\nOften times these State Machines are nested.\nBy considering our Matrix Model as a set of not only things our Application\nneeds to be able to do, but also as a set of States that represent distinct contexts within which a User of our Application\ncan enter or move through, you open up the door to more.\nStepping back from a simple\nClient-Server Application of Request/Reply to focus on the Platform idea, you start to focus on how Users experience our\nApplications and how our Applications experience our Users interacting with it at all\nlevels regardless of how that is accomplished.  You recognize that any Application is a State\nMachine with Application Contexts representing the state at any given moment.  You also see\nthat the totality of the state of an Application at any given moment in time is the aggregation\nof a set of Application Contexts that the User is currently experiencing or the User has\ninitiated within the Application, e.g. a User can be Viewing a Folder in the Admin while also\nAdding Content to that Folder.\nWith this Model you see the possibilities unfolding ahead of you for building this Platform.\nRemember that the Matrix Model is now representing the set of Application Contexts that a User\nwill experience or flow through as the User interacts with the Application.\nGlobal Features\nYou're now excited about this Platform architecture and using Application Contexts as the\nextension points for building Features and Modules when you start to wonder if there are Features\nthat would be harder to add within this model, or just don't fit.  You immediately consider\nwhether audit logging is a Feature or not.\nWhy not?\nBeyond logging for diagnostics information in troubleshooting, audit logging is for keeping track\nof who did what and when so that the application can provide that information to those who need\nto know who's making changes to the system and verifying whether they should have that ability or\nnot.\nIn other words, it occurs to you that there are some Features you want to build that will be interested in\nmore than one Orientation or Term or even more than one Action.\nDoes it make sense to force developers to have to\nhook into/extend the Application at each point?  How large and burdensome can that get?  What about Features that come along later with new Application Contexts that weren't expected?\nAOP\nNot many have heard of it, but once upon a time, in January 2003 I attended a lecture by Ivar Jacobson, one of the 3 creators of Rational, the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and UML.  In his lecture he mentioned Aspect-Oriented Programming.  I even won a raffle that he signed a copy of his book to me.\n \nDuring the lecture, Ivar spoke about several topics, namely his primary topic of Testing Designs\n(before they make it to code), but he also threw out another topic I had to look up later (smart\nphones were not a thing yet).  He mentioned AOP.\nAspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) makes a distinction between business component logic, that\nwhich is particular to a specific part of an application, versus Cross-Cutting Concerns, or those\nparts of an application that \"cross-cut\" all components, the most obvious example being logging.\nAs you think about the Audit Logging feature, you're reminded of AOP and that it's a cross-cutting\nconcern for not only applications, but the platform itself.\nHow can we enable the audit logging as a \"cross-cutting\" concern to be built using our extension\nmechanism?  Is it even possible?\nYou realize that if you could solve this, then it would enable the Platform design to provide\ncross-cutting capabilities for extension like what's expected in AOP without having to change the design of\nthe extension point mechanism and without the distaste of providing a new and competing\nextension point mechanism for the Platform.\nWildcards\nWhat if we allow a Feature that is using the Platform's extension point mechanism to essentially\nsubscribe to all of the Application Contexts that occur, or only those that occur on a given dimension or two, leaving the other dimension(s) free from being fixed?\nYou realize that by allowing this level of freedom, you enable a whole set of capabilities for\nbuilding Features without changing our extension point mechanism.  While this will certainly\naffect how it has to be implemented, the extension point mechanism for developers is demonstrably\nenhanced without changing its interface or having to introduce another competing mechanism.\nSo instead of being limited to only fixed Application Contexts like:\n\n{Content, Create, Admin}\n{Folder-Content, View, Portal}\n\ndevelopers can also make use of:\n\n{*, *, *}\n{Content, *, Admin}\n{*, *, Portal}\n\nRepresenting Application Contexts\nYou feel very good about these decisions and more emboldened by how it's going to empower\ndevelopers to build on top of the Platform's Matrix Model of Application Contexts, while be able\nto provide a single mechanism to extend the Platform.\nNext up you start to consider how to represent Application Contexts and how to actually deliver\na programmable interface that developers can use in building what becomse a Reactive\nsystem.\n"},"story/reactive.html":{"url":"story/reactive.html","title":"Reactive","keywords":"","body":"Reactive Development\nAs you think through the API you need to provide for the Platform, you start to consider how these\nApplicaton Contexts should actually work:\nWhat are Application Contexts from a development standpoint?\nWhat does it mean for an Application Context to represent State?\nHow does a developer \"hook into\" or \"subscribe to\" an Application Context?\nEvents\nYou realize that Application Contexts are State Events that can be triggered by the application\nwhen the application needs to perform the work for that State.  Many Platforms and Frameworks are\nalready built this way, using predefined events to determine the extension points for developers\nto \"hook into\" or \"subscribe to\" so you feel comfortable you're not doing anything too far\nfetched.\nWhat you have done new is to provide some dimensionality and richness to the scheme used to define\nthe events as well as the capability of subscribing to multiple events using a wildcard mechanism.\nTo your knowledge, neither of those have been done before.\nSo you decide to make a distinction between a materialized State with specifics captured in the\ndata associated with that state, and define that as an Applciation Context.  The \"listener\"\nmechanism then defines which Trigrams that will match specific Application Contexts that it cares about.\nWe now have the following distinction to be clear:\n\n\n\nName\nDefinition\nCan be Wild\n\n\n\n\nTrigram\n3-tuple determining which Application Contexts to subscribe to\nYes\n\n\nApplication Context\nSpecific state event of an application combining a Trigram with Data\nNo\n\n\n\nThis feels right as you look to translate how this mechanism will work to UI code that requires\nnot only display of viewable components to the user, but also the ability to react to what the\nuser does.\nMessages\nFrom your early learning of Object Oriented Programming, you remember that method calls are\nconsidered to be passing messages from one object to another.  There's several reasons why this is\nthe case, but as you think about it from the concept of method dispatch in a prototypal chain, it\nmakes sense that a call to a method is a message being sent and a search for the correct handler\nof that message.\nEvents are just another form of message dispatch with an inverted \"pointer\" as to to the intended\ntarget of the message.  With an object-to-object method call as a message, the caller is fully\naware of who the target of the message is.  With events using the Observer Pattern,\nto decouple the sender from the receiver as well as allowing there to be multiple receivers in a\nfanout pattern.\nIf it's all messages in the end, you think, then why can't my Application Contexts be messages in\na network?\nThis would make the Platform more applicable to building applications that can cross process and\nnetwork boundaries, and distribute the execution of Features and Modules to where they need.\nReactive Manifesto\nThis makes you feel even better about your choices now.  You realize that you've extended a very\nsimple extension point mechanism to fit a wide variety of usage scenarios while helping to ensure\napplications can be built better to scale as needed.\nYou've designed the Platform to adhere to The Reactive Manifesto\nand you're feeling even more confident now that you're not building a Platform that will become\nbrittle with age.  Especially this part:\n\nMessage Driven: Reactive Systems rely on asynchronous message-passing to establish a\nboundary between components that ensures loose coupling, isolation and location transparency.\nThis boundary also provides the means to delegate failures as messages. Employing explicit\nmessage-passing enables load management, elasticity, and flow control by shaping and monitoring\nthe message queues in the system and applying back-pressure when necessary. Location\ntransparent messaging as a means of communication makes it possible for the management of\nfailure to work with the same constructs and semantics across a cluster or within a single\nhost. Non-blocking communication allows recipients to only consume resources while active,\nleading to less system overhead.\n\n\n[Credit: The Reactive Manifesto site: https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/images/reactive-traits.svg]\nMessage Flow\nAs you consider the implications of your decisions, you wonder about how Features builders can\ntake full advantage of a Platform that would provide this Network where messages get added and\ndelivered to anything that is listening for them.\nYou know with these latest decisions we can build our system to be Reactive, but you're not sure\nif that alone is enough to handle all of the use cases that can come up for features of the Media\nManagement application.\nThere are times when we need to control if messages propagate and how messages propagate.\nAutomatic Chaining\nOften times we want to kick off a chain of our Application Contexts in response to an initial\nstimulus.  To provide some control over the flow of those messages, you realize it would be\nhelpful if there was a way to automatically chain from one message to another.  In fact, chaining\ninto a full path of messages would provide 2 additional benefits to the Platform and its\nextension mechanism:\n\nAllow a dynamic assembly of handlers to provide a chain of value\nAllow a dynamic set of hooks into which a new handler can be inserted at any time\n\nYou decide to design the Network so that if it receives an Application Context as the result\nof a handler call, then it will use that as the next Application Context being set in the Network.\nThis also allows the handlers to not have to be aware of the Network in which they're being\nattached, operating as pure functions which can live and execute anywhere giving even more\nlocation transparency.\nInline\nA basic and simple chaining rule is one where one Application Context comes after another\nin a line so to speak, so that when the handler of an Application Context is finished, the next\nApplication Context is fired, and the next set of handlers pick it up.\nAsynchronous\nHaving developed many applications that perform some sort of tracking, and knowing that our Media\nManagement application needs to have tracking of how long users watch content, you understand that\nthe tracking message itself should be an asynchronous process or side-effect of the watching\naction.\nDefining a chaining mechanism that allows for Application Contexts to be chained from one another\nAsynchronously will allow extensions to be built that provide side effects when certain messages\nare populated on the network.  These chains can in turn be longer when combined with Inline\nhandling to kick off whole message flows in an asynchronous execution.\nIntercept\nFinally, when you begin to consider security implications and how to handle authorization, you\nrealize there are times when you want to stop the propagation of a chain of Application Contexts.\nIn these cases, you want to Intercept an Application Context to inspect it and determine whether\nit should propagate or not, and possibly provide the Network with an alternative Application Context\nto follow instead.\nThis works for not only authorization scenarios but basic validation and many other scenarios\nyou may not anticipate yet.\nPrioritized Flow Control\nWhile you like this model of having these 3 different types of mechanisms for chaining Application Contexts\ntogether to provide value, you are worried about the deterministic behavior needed for developers\nbuilding Features:\n\nHow can they be certain that their Intercept handler will be called?\nHaw can they ensure that their side-effects will always fire before the Application moves onto another Application Context?\nAs a developer, do I have to ensure the order in which I attach handlers to the Network?  How can I do that in a dynamic execution environment?\n\nYou decide what's missing is clear Prioritization for how Application Contexts will be chained,\nand come up with the following:\n\nIntercept handlers will always fire first to determine whether the incoming Application Context is valid for further propagation in the network\nAsync handlers will always fire next in a way that spins off a new execution context, enabling all side effects that make it passed the Intercept to get triggered\nAll Inline handlers will be fired for the given Application Context before any new Application Contexts that are chained from Inline handlers are set in the network\n\nPlatform Defined\nWith this in place, you realize you've defined everything you need to build a Platform that can be\nused to not only build the Media Management application to meet the original Requirements,\nbut you feel like you've defined something a bit more.  Something that is useful\nbeyond the needs of this project and generalized enough to apply to many more applications and\nprojects.\n"},"story/the-tao.html":{"url":"story/the-tao.html","title":"End Result","keywords":"","body":"End Result\nOur end result is the TAO Programming Model.  It starts from defining software as a set of\nApplication Contexts that an application will go through or allow, using\nthe TAO Trigram as the basis for the definition:\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient(ation)\n\nFrom their the application is built creating code that sets Application Contexts as signals into a Network and creating handlers that attach to the Network as either:\n\nan Inline handler\nan Async handler\nor an Intercept handler\n\nThis programming model is designed around building Reactive applications that are scalable and resilient while being decoupled and focused on the evolution of applications.\nIn other words, adding features and functionality use a common built-in mechanism to the\nProgramming Model that provide consistency across the entire life of the application.\nWith the TAO Programming Model, we are able to realize the following benefits:\nBusiness-first Messaging Pattern\nYou realize that the TAO Programming Model with its use of Trigrams provides the first\nbusiness-first message pattern.  Because the concept of Trigrams came from Application Contexts\nwhich came from how to describe the software from a requirements perspective that can translate\nto engineers, the TAO Programming Model is the first outright messaging pattern defined from the\nstart to describe Domain Models and use Business Language from the Domain Model.\nTranslating to Code\nSo you have an Event System that is also way beyond the events you're used to.  But this is good.\nYou're following successful patterns that have proven useful by making the platform event-based at\nthe same time you've made those events more descriptive and universal.  You're providing\na single common extension point mechanism to build anything for your applications while making the\nPlatform's callbacks more powerful.\nStepping back upstream a little, you realize the impact this could have.  Because the event\nmechanism came in a straight line directly from an attempt to capture requirements, you realize\nthat the mechanism for developing the code of applications built using the Platform is directly\ntranslatable to and from a language used to describe what the application needs to do.\nAs the Product Team works with the Engineering Team, using Application Contexts and Trigrams to\ndefine the requirements of the application makes for a common language between the two teams,\nthe language is will not only pervade the Product Requirements documentation, it'll also be\nvisible directly in the code that is written to realize the requirements of the application.\nDecoupled from the Start\nWhen building applications using the TAO Programming Model, the features are decoupled from the\nstart.  Relying on message passing to affect the behavior of the application much in the way a\nPub-Sub system works to decouple message Publishers from message Subscribers.  The TAO Programming\nModel does this at a level where it is universal across your application.\nAs we know from the first half of the GoF Design Patterns book, the best way to decouple software\ncomponents is to:\n\nPrincipal: Design to an Interface\n\nEffectively, building applications using the TAO Programming Model provides a mechanism for creating dynamic Interfaces.  Each Trigram represents an Interface to which a handler can attach\nitself.\nAs new things or features are introduced to the application, new Trigrams will be formed based on\nthe Terms, Actions and Orientations of the feature.  New or old Features can attach to these\nTrigrams at any time, awaiting matching Application Contexts and reacting to them.\nPlatforms for Everyone\nWhat if every application could be built as if it were a platform?\nWhat if every application used the same mechanism to extend its functionality as it did to build\nits first feature?\nWhat if every application were built upon a mechanism designed for evolving the application over\nthe course of its lifetime, and that same mechanism was used to evolve it from its inception at\nday 0?\nThat's the effect of using the TAO Programming Model.  It could be described as a Framework for\nbuilding Platforms.  You build up a Platform for your application that allows you to extend your\napplication as if you were extending on a Platform.  You also have the flexibility to make this\navailable to Integrators wanting to build for your application.\nThe beauty of the TAO Programming Model is that it provides a way for application developers to\nbuild in a Platform design, a Platform mindset, without taking on the burdens of defining or\ndesigning a Platform.  It comes as a Platform to start.  It is a Meta-Platform used to build\nPlatforms on which to build applications.\nNo Lock-In\nThe TAO Programming Model itself also has no opinions about what technologies to use or how to\nimplement the functionality for interacting with a data store like an ORM.  So as a Framework,\nyou as a developer don't suffer from the strong opinions made for expediency.\nBuilding applications using the TAO Programming Model, you are not locked into any specific\ntechnology choices made by the Framework developers.  It's designed as a mechanism to help you\nbuild applications that are expected to evolve, so the TAO Programming Model aids you in that\nevolution.\nDecoupling Apps from Architecture\nBecause of the design of the TAO Programming Model, there is a clear separation between what is\nused to define the Product and how that becomes part of the code as the App and the Network on\nwhich the App's Application Context messages and message handlers operate as the Architecture.\nUsing the TAO Programming Model we can define Apps with:\n\nset of Application Contexts or Trigrams that the App will provide\nset of handlers to respond to Application Contexts\nand how those handlers attach to the Network\n\nAlso, with the TAO Programming Model we can define Architecture with:\n\nthe Network used to carry Application Contexts\n\nAs long as the Network implements the guarantees provided by the TAO Programming Model, we are\nfree to change the App and Architecture independent of one another.  Adding new Application Contexts\nand handlers will not affect the Network.  Changing the Network implementation will not affect\nthe Application Contexts or handlers used to implement our App.\nLearn more in the page about it here\nEmbracing Entropy\n\nAll software heads toward entropy\n\n… is a direct quote from my first career boss.\nSince the TAO Programming Model was built to evolve from the start, it is designed to embrace this\nfact as outlined further in Entropy in Software\n"},"intro/":{"url":"intro/","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to tao.js\nWhat is TAO and tao.js\nIt helps to set the stage for what TAO development in tao.js is based on from where you're coming:\n\nClient Side, Event-driven development\nBack end API development\nBack end Messaging development\n\nWhy do I want this\n\nDecoupling Application from Architecture - evolve each independently\nA Framework for Building a Platform - the best of both worlds\nEntropy in Software - all software is heading for entropy\nAntifragile Software - making software that is as antifragile as its product\nMotivations & Goals of tao.js - why tao.js and for what purpose\n\nHow do I use this\n\nBasic Terminology - some basic terminology used throughout the text\nBasic Usage Guide - start here to learn the usage\nAdvanced Usage Guide - go here to learn more about what's possible\n\nWhere is this going\n\nDevelopment Roadmap - what's coming\n\n"},"intro/as-events.html":{"url":"intro/as-events.html","title":"Client Side, Event-driven development","keywords":"","body":"From Client-side Event-driven Dev to tao.js\nMany of you will be coming from Client-side development which is Event-driven, relying on the user\nto begin interactions that drive what the application does.\ntao.js operates as Event-driven\nThis is good news because you're already used to attaching an event handler to UI components in\norder to react to when the user interacts with that component.\ntao.js provides the same mechanism in which you attach handlers to the TAO and implement the\nfunctionality of your application using those handlers.\nSimilar to Event-driven architectures, you can attach as many handlers as you\nThere are a few differences that you will need to know to understand:\nTAO uses Domain Events\nWhen building applications with tao.js, the events that you will listen for will be Domain-specific (Business-oriented) as opposed to Component-specific events.\nTAO events are 3-Dimensional\nMost of the events you're used to can be considered 1-Dimensional or 2-Dimensional.\n1-Dimensional in the sense that you can only attach to events by their name.\n2-Dimensional in the sense that you can only attach to a named event on a specific object or\ncomponent.\nTAO uses 3-Dimensional events that represent not only the object target (as term) and the action\nbeing performed but also the orientation of when and where the event is occurring to form a\ncomplete Application Context from the Domain.\nTAO allows Wildcard Handlers\nHow many times have you wanted to attach a handler that could listen for many events of a similar\nnature?\nTAO handlers can be attached using a wildcard for any of the 3 dimensions or any combination of the\n3 dimensions of a message.\nSimilar to the Flux Pattern\nThe TAO Programming Model espouses a pattern very similar to the Flux Pattern for forward-only\ndata flow.

Don't we have libraries and frameworks that do this already?\nThere are several motivations behind creating tao.js that originate from a need to\ndescribe software effectively for technical members (developers, QA, etc.) and non-technical\nmembers (product managers, designers, etc.) of teams alike.\nThis original need led to the creation of the TAO and implemented in tao.js as a way to\nbuild applications and systems which then presented an opportunity to achieve the original inspired intent of communicating a description of software through a simple grammar.\nBrief Origin Story\nVery briefly, what initially started by using a 3-Dimensional Matrix to describe the needs\nof an Application Platform turned into a way to model an Application.  When combined with\nsome other architectural models, this new model or way, aka the TAO, then materialized\ninto a core architecture for writing Applications.\nShort Systems Engineering Theory of the TAO\nWith the realization that the TAO could be used to actually build the software it was being\nused to describe, it became apparent there was a lot of value in a system that could\nbe used to build software which had its design roots stemming from defining the software in\nthe abstract or non-technical way.\nBreaking down the concept of Software Architecture to its basist core, it can be defined as:\n\nthe set of answers to the questions posed by a Software Engineer when it comes time to\nimplement a feature of an Application or System\n\nUsing the TAO as an architecture thus means it's providing these answers when it comes time\nto build an Application and add features to it.\nThis system, to be effective, should be ubiquitous and have the capacity to write\nall code required to implement the desired Application or System.  The ubiquity of JavaScript\nand its unique ability to run in any execution stack (specifically in clients and servers)\nmade it the obvious choice for an initial implementation to both prove the theory of the\nsystem and its benefits.  Additionally, the choice of JavaScript allows leveraging the\nexisting ecosystem to get enough people to try it to validate the proof.\nHence the birth of tao.js.  However, to be truly ubiquitous and provide the most value,\nwe would eventually like to port the TAO to other languages and frameworks, and will\ngraciously accept help in that regard.\nMotivations\nThe origin and theory behind the TAO led to a set of 4 distinct motivations, each with their\nown set of goals:\n\nBuild Apps in a Way that allows them to Evolve effectively\nMake it Easy to build Apps with good Architectural Foundations\nCodify Software Product Descriptions\nEmpower Developers with Flexibility of Technology Choices\n\nWe'll step through each motivation here.\n1. Build Apps in a Way that allows them to Evolve effectively \n\nIt's the desire of all code to become legacy\n- Wise Old Developer\n\nAs developers and product managers, we want to build Applications that have a chance to evolve\nover time.\nPrimary to the TAO is a desire to build Applications in a highly Iterative fashion so that\na core value is easy to create, and the App can evolve effectively in any direction as necessary\nwithout the unnecessary introduction of technical debt.\nThis comes with 2 Primary Goals:\n\nApplications are always composable and decoupled\nBuild Apps like Building on a Platform\nUse a mechanism built-in for Extension Points that can expand over time\nAny App built with the TAO can be injected with New Features during execution\nFeatures unknown at the beginning of the life of an App are added the same as the First\nFeature\n\n\n\n2. Make it Easy to build Apps with good Architectural Foundations \nAfter many decades of building software, our industry has devised different architectural\npatterns that are effective at decoupling implementations while providing scalability and\nperformance.  The Reactive Manifesto describes the\ngoals of such an architecture with a prescription for Reactive Systems.\nUnfortunately, most projects don't begin by utilizing this architectural pattern because the\noverhead of effort required to get started doesn't outweigh the immediate need to\nshow some value for a customer to prove the need for the existence of the App.  And thus\nbegins the never ending cycle of prototypes that become MVPs that morph into businesses\nthat then require some eventual rewrite in order to scale the business.\nUsing the TAO, we want it to be easy to begin building Reactive Systems from the start without\nadditional overhead.  By achieving this we can avoid entirely or greatly reduce the\nintroduction of technical debt without the added cost of time.\nThis creates several Goals for the TAO:\n\nSimplified Adoption of Reactive Message-driven Apps\nBusiness Logic code that can be executed anywhere in the System\nNo distinction enforced by the framework within the code that it executes on client,\nserver, embedded, or in a data pipeline\n\n\nProgram by Contract with a Dynamic Interface Definition Language (IDL)\nApps have Integration built-in\nSystem-wide Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)\nThe Last Architecture you have to adopt with confidence\n\n3. Codify Software Product Descriptions \nThe TAO was born out of a way to describe Software Requirements to Engineers that ensures\nall aspects of the desired system were taken into account when designing the User and\nSystem Interfaces.\nThe most common complaints about Engineering Teams are:\n\nthe app is poorly made and doesn't meet our requirements\nthey're taking too long to build it\n\nThe primary source of these 2 complaints is ineffective descriptions of the desired outcome\nin the form of Software Requirements.\nWe want the TAO to be a primary tool used for describing software as a Simplified\nGrammar to Codify the description of the desired Application in order to:\n\nmake Product Managers better by:\ngiving them a device that is easy to learn\ngetting them closer to the code elements of an App\nidentify gaps in requirements before planning or implementation\nreduce the verbosity required by BDD\n\n\nmake Engineering Teams better by:\nbeing on the same page with Product Managers\ngiving them a device to elicit requirements effectively\ncommunicating relevant implementation decisions better\n\n\n\nThis leads to several Goals:\n\nEngineers, QA & Product Managers have a Shared Grammar making it easy to:\nHave access to all aspects of a feature in planning before execution\nEffectively discuss and debate implementation details during planning\n\n\nProvide a Meta-language for Product Description that embeds itself into the code (Traceability)\nProduct Managers can create Artifacts that generate starting point boilerplate code\nSelf-documenting code\n\n4. Empower Developers with Flexibility of Technology Choices \nFinally, there are a lot of frameworks in the eco-system that are designed to make\nRapid Application Development (RAD) easy to adopt.  Generally these frameworks provide\ntooling support to add and make changes.  But these frameworks have several\nflaws:\n\nLocked into rigid development paradigms unable to evolve with the pace of modern technology\nsystems and patterns\nNot built as Reactive Systems that scale across Micro-service architectures or no discrete\nway to integrate Message-oriented data flows\nDumbing down of data store technologies to the lowest common denominator making the specific\nchoice indistinguishable from the others\nDifficulty to upgrade and support major versions without a responsibility from the maintainers\nbecause it's \"Open Source\" (buyer beware)\nVariance in the mechanism for extension points amongst frameworks tying the implementation\ncode to the framework\n\nThe TAO provides a frameworkless framework approach.  The TAO's programming paradigm could\nitself be considered a framework, but motivation behind the TAO is to support and encourage\nthe ability for developers to choose any technology or other framework they desire to\nimplement their Apps while gaining all of the benefits of using the TAO.\nThe Goals that come from this motivation are:\n\nA Framework that doesn't lock Developers into Technology Choices\nProvide powerful tooling to support and speed development\nFramework that encourages choosing the right tool for the job by enhancing the\ndistinctions between technology choices and allowing them to live side-by-side seamlessly\nFully Configurable or Configuration by Convention, the choice is up to the Developer\n\nFull Goal Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\n\n1.Motivation: Build Apps in a Way that allows them to Evolve effectively\n\n\n\n1.\nApplications are always composable and decoupled\n\n\n\n2.\nBuild Apps like Building on a Platform\n\n\n2.Motivation: Make it Easy to build Apps with good Architectural Foundations\n\n\n\n1.\nSimplified Adoption of Reactive Message-driven Apps\n\n\n\n2.\nBusiness Logic code that can be executed anywhere in the System\n\n\n\n3.\nProgram by Contract with a Dynamic Interface Definition Language (IDL)\n\n\n\n4.\nApps have Integration built-in\n\n\n\n5.\nSystem-wide Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)\n\n\n\n6.\nThe Last Architecture you have to adopt with confidence\n\n\n3.Motivation: Codify Software Product Descriptions\n\n\n\n1.\nEngineers, QA & Product Managers have a Shared Grammar\n\n\n\n2.\nProvide a Meta-language for Product Description that embeds itself into the code\n\n\n\n3.\nProduct Managers can create Artifacts that generate starting point boilerplate code\n\n\n\n4.\nSelf-documenting code\n\n\n4.Motivation: Empower Developers with Flexibility of Technology Choices\n\n\n\n1.\nA Framework that doesn't lock Developers into Technology Choices\n\n\n\n2.\nProvide powerful tooling to support and speed development\n\n\n\n3.\nFramework that encourages choosing the right tool for the job\n\n\n\n4.\nSupport Fully Configurable and Configuration by Convention\n\n\n\n"},"intro/basic-terms.html":{"url":"intro/basic-terms.html","title":"Basic Terminology","keywords":"","body":"Basic Terminology\nAt its core, an Application is a set of State Machines\nconsisting of various States, Transitions from state to state, and Rules and Logic that\nconstrain the transitions between states.\nAbstract States represented by 3-Dimensional Tuples \ntao.js expresses the Abstract States of an Application to represent distinct Application Contexts\nthrough the use of 3-Dimensional tuples.  These tuples are referred to as trigrams because of their\ndistinct structure defined by 3 specific aspects:\nTerm - the thing in the context - conceptually usually a domain entityAction - the operation being performed on the thing in the contextOrient(ation) - the perspective of the interaction with the system at\nthe moment of this operation on this thing  \nTrigrams are formally defined in description and in code using distinct Strings for each aspect\nmaking up a member of the Set.An example trigram descriptor using set notation would be: {User, Find, Portal}Translating this to code that executes with tao.js you will see it as either:\n\nan Object hash: { t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }OR\nan Array of strict ordering based on the TAO acronym: ['User', 'Find', 'Portal']\n\nTrigrams represent possible states of the application as a context that can be executed\nwithin the application.\nAppCons are Actual States\ntao.js expresses the Actual States of an Application through the use of AppCons, representing\nApplication Contexts through which an Actor transitions while interacting with the Application.\nAppCons differ from trigrams in that they can (not required) include associated data for any or all\nof the 3 aspects of the trigram.\nThis is most often expressed as an individual or list of Objects that represent the Term for\nthe given Context, but don't limit your thinking to attaching all individual AppCon data to\nTerms alone.  Distinct Actions can also be expressed with the Action's data, e.g. Find could contain either an individual id used to fetch the given Object representing the Term or a set of search criteria to get a list of Objects representing the Term.

The tao arg\nis an Object with the following properties:\n\nt: string - the Term of the trigram\na: string - the Action of the trigram\no: string - the Orientation of the trigram\n\nThese properties not only allow for your handler to know exactly why it was triggered, they are\nuseful for:\n\nhaving the keys to access the data object's child data\nallowing Wilcard Handlers to know which trigram triggered the handler to be called\n\ndata: object handler arg\nThe TAO will pass the data used when the AppCon was triggered to all handlers that are registered\nto handle the trigram.\ndata will always receive an Object, even if it is empty ({}) so your handler can rely on\nthis and not have to worry about destructuring the data parameter against an undefined or null\narg.\ndata can have 0 - 3 keys defined on it depending on what was passed to the TAO when setting\nthe context to the specific Application Context that triggered the call to your handler.\nEach key in data will be set as the concrete trigram available from the tao arg,\ne.g. if the trigram is { t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' } then data can contain the\nkeys 'App', 'Enter' and 'Portal' depending on which aspect was provided data when the\nApplication Context was set on the TAO.\ndata will always have this  structure no matter which form is used to pass data\non setting Application Context, including data args to setCtx\nor data args to AppCon constructor.\nThis behavior is specifically by design to allow for multiple ways of setting the data while\nproviding a consistent and reliable API for creating your Handlers.\ndata will be the same reference for all handlers called so take care not to manipulate the\nobject your handler receives, rather make a new object if you want to make changes.\nAdding Handlers for AppCons\nThe TAO provides 3 different types of Handlers which you can see in the Advanced Section.  For learning the Basics here, we will illustrate use with the most widely\nused and easiest to understand Handlers, called Inline Handlers.\nTo add a handler for an AppCon, first make sure you've imported the TAO in the file you intend to\nadd the handler from:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\nOR\nconst TAO = require('@tao.js/core');\n\nHandlers are added directly on the TAO by using one of the add[Type]Handler(…) methods and\npassing the following 2 arguments:\n\ntrigram: object - the trigram your handler cares about\ncan take either short form keys ({ t, a, o }) or\nlong form keys ({ term, action, orient }).\n\n\nhandler: function - function you want to be called when an AppCon matching the given trigram is set on the TAO\n\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data[tao.t]title}`);\n});\n\nHandler Function Return Value\nThe TAO only cares about the Return Value of a Handler in 2 cases which are described in further\ndetail in other sections:\n\nan AppCon as the return value is used for Chaining AppCons\nan truthy or falsey return values from an Intercept Handler\n\nAll other return values are ignored so you can potentially use the same function as a handler\nfor the TAO as well as in other areas of your application.  It's up to you.\nSpecial Note: with Decorators on the Roadmap we may allow automating\nthe setting of return values into an AppCon.\nArrow Functions vs Other Functions\nTo the TAO, the handler is a Function and it doesn't care what form that function came to it\nas.  We used an arrow function above to illustrate a common case, but the following\nare all equivalent and will achieve the same result when it comes to handling AppCons.\nIf this is obvious to you and you needn't bother then skip ahead to Async Function Handlers below.\nArrow Function as const definition\nconst handleAppEnterPortal = (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n};\n\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\nFunction declaration\nfunction handleAppEnterPortal(tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma!

It's suggested\nthat your handlers catch Errors and handle them by setting the Application Context\nto something signaling the Error like using action: 'Fail'.\nRemoving Handlers\nBecause we can add new handlers at any point in the lifecycle of our app, the TAO allows for\ndynamic loading and unloading of handlers in response to any events, namely but not limited\nto Application Contexts or if used with Code Splitting.\nIf you want to remove a handler from the TAO, you will need to keep a reference to it somewhere\nthat is accessible to the code that will remove it from the TAO.\nTo remove a handler, make sure you are removing the handler using the same type that you used\nto add the handler function, using the corollary remove[Type]Handler method to the add[Type]Handler.\nconst handleAppEnterPortal = (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n};\n\n// add the handler\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\n…\n// Somwhere else\n\n// remove the handler\nTAO.removeInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n// OR\nTAO.removeInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\nNamed Function Definitions are hoisted\nso they can be defined inline and referenced elsewhere, e.g.:\n// add the handler\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, function handleAppEnterPortal(tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n…\n// Somwhere in same file\n\n// remove the handler\nTAO.removeInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\nMissing Handler\nWhen attempting to remove a handler from the TAO, if either the handler is not registered for the\ntrigram you specify or the trigram you specify doesn't have any handlers then the request is\nsimply ignored.\nThe Decorators Spec\nIt's expected soon the Decorators Spec will be approved and made part of JavaScript.  With that\ncoming, it makes perfect sense to allow using decorators to wire up handlers for you, so expect\nthis to come in the future roadmap.\nSeveral reasons why it's not implemented already:\n\nJust trying to get this in people's hands to get feedback first - waiting for a decorators\nimplementation would have made it easier to adopt, but also take longer\nReact.js originally had an implementation of Decorators that they had to rip out once the\nnascient spec was not approved to be added to the language.  I made the decision then not\nto implement my React apps using Decorators and it paid off by not having to go back and\nchange my implementation, so it's easier to be patient here.\n\n"},"basics/chaining.html":{"url":"basics/chaining.html","title":"Chaining AppCons","keywords":"","body":"Chaining AppCons\nOne of the principles of the TAO is using fine-grained Application Contexts\nto provide a programming paradigm grounded in Functional Programming.\nHandlers can tell the TAO which Application Context is next after they\ncomplete their execution by returning an AppCon to the caller.\nUsing this mechanism, a System Actor (like a User)'s interaction with\nour app can trigger a single Application Context which then triggers\na multitude of Application Contexts to generate and track the correct\nbehaviors of our application.\nThis design allows us to use fine-grained Application Context definitions\nin order to keep our handlers small and focused on a Single Responsibility,\noffering to allow downstream Application Contexts to react to what the\nhandler has done.\nExample Chain\nBorrowing and reprinting from our earlier Example AppCon Descriptions:\n\n\n\nfrom TAO\nto TAO\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n{App,Enter,Portal}\ninitial TAO that sets the App in motion (this can be anything you want)\n\n\n{App,Enter,Portal}\n->{App,View,Portal}\nafter entering, we want to show the App's Portal\n\n\n{App,View,Portal}\n->{Space,Find,Portal}\nvisitng the App's initial Portal View triggers a fetch for the items that should be visible\n\n\n{Space,Find,Portal}\n->{Space,List,Portal}\nwith the items, render the list for the User\n\n\n\nWe see that we want the {App,Enter,Portal} Application Context to\ntrigger the {App,View,Portal} Application Context.\nMust use AppCon Constructor\nThe TAO only reacts to AppCons which are returned from handlers and\nnot any other form of an Application Context or trigram.  The TAO will not\ninspect the return value of a handler other than to determine if it is\nof AppCon type.\nThis does allow you to extend the AppCon class if you so desire and\nreturning those will still work.  However, it's better to favor\nComposition over Inheritance so this isn't something you really\nshould consider.\nChaining AppCon in Code\nIn order for our handler to chain to another AppCon, we need to ensure\nwe are importing both the TAO and AppCon constructor where we plan to\ndo it:\nimport TAO, { AppCon } from '@tao.js/core';\n\nOR\nconst TAO, { AppCon } = require('@tao.js/core');\n\nHere is a sample handler that ensures the TAO goes to the\n{App,View,Portal} Application Context when it is finished:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  const title = data.title;\n  setWindowTitleSomehow(title);\n  return new AppCon('App', 'View', 'Portal', data);\n});\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  const title = data.title;\n  setWindowTitleSomehow(title);\n  return new AppCon('App', 'View', 'Portal', data);\n});\n\nIt's as simple as that, yet this mechanism becomes a very powerful force in\nallowing us to split up our code into fine-grained handlers that only\nfocus and care about one thing, and chain them together to create protocols\nto handle the rich interactivity and business logic of our apps.\n"},"basics/wildcards.html":{"url":"basics/wildcards.html","title":"Wildcard Handlers","keywords":"","body":"Wildcard Handlers\nOne of the principle Motivations behind\nthe TAO is to build Systems and Applications that are fundamentally\ndesigned to Evolve by using the concepts behind\nAspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).\nMost implementations of AOP use something to inject code\nWildcard Handlers allow us to add handlers to the TAO that are called\nwhen any of the Concrete trigram aspects match the Application Context\nset on the TAO.\nThis is one feature that sets tao.js apart from any other Event-driven\nmechanisms by allowing a Subscriber (handler) to subscribe to\nEvents (AppCons) of any kind along a specific axis or axes (or none)\nin order to react over a broad spectrum of similar Events.\nWildcard Handlers can choose to focus on a specific Term, Action,\nor Orientation or some subset of those 3 or none at all.\nWildcard vs Concrete\nConcrete trigram aspects are specifically named Terms, Actions or\nOrientations.  They are called \"Concrete\" in that they are set and\ndo not change to be something else.\nFor example: in {App,Enter,Portal}, the entire trigram is\nconsidered a Concrete Application Context because it specifically\ndefines each aspect of the trigram for the Application Context.\nEach specifically defined aspect of the trigram is itself a Concrete\nAspect, in this case a Concrete Term, Concrete Action and Concrete\nOrient(ation).\nWildcard trigrams are those that leave one or more of the trigram\naspects undefined or \"not Concrete.\"\nWhat Wildcard trigrams look like\nWildcard trigrams can be defined in various different ways, the\nmajority of which is to simply leave the trigram property out.\nExample basic Wildcard trigrams:\n{ t: 'App', o: 'Portal' } // Action is left Wild\n{ t: 'App' } // Action and Orient are left wild\n{} // All 3 Aspects (Term, Action & Orient) are left wild\n\nYou can also use empty strings ('') or asterisks (*) to\ndefine Wild trigram aspects.\nsupport for asterisks (*) is due to that is a generalized\nway to describe Wildcard trigrams when describing the software\nto be written using the TAO\nExamples:\n{ t: 'App', a: '', o: 'Portal' } // Action is defined Wild\n{ t: 'App', a: '*', o: '*' } // Action and Orient are defined wild\n{ a: '', o: '*' } // All 3 Aspects are Wild, and the style is mixed\n\nAdding a Wildcard Handler\nAdding a Wildcard Handler to the TAO is the same as adding a Concrete\nHandler to the TAO.\nWildcard Handler for all AppCons on a Term\nconst handleApp = (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma!

As the first part of understanding the 3 different Types or Modes of handlers,\nit's best to start with Inline Handlers which most closely resemble what you're used to with\ntraditional Event-based handlers.\nInline = Ordered\nInline Handlers operate like standard Event listeners in other areas of JavaScript in that the\nhandlers are expected to be called in the order in which they were registered (added) to the\nTAO for a given trigram (\"Event\").\nThis expectation is modified when it comes to using Wildcard Handlers\nbecause internally each trigram is managing it's own set of handlers.  While all matching\nWildcard Handlers will be called along with all of the Concrete Handlers, they will be called in\nthe order that the trigrams themselves were added to the TAO, and the order per trigram that each\nhandler was added as this will be the traversal order used by the TAO.\nOrdering of Inline Handler execution is not a guarantee provided by the TAO, and the\nunderlying implementation may change, causing any code written that relies on this explanation\nof ordering to be executed in a different order.\nSuffice to say, it's best not to rely on exact ordering for handlers in the TAO, even Inline\nHandlers, and write them as if they can be called at any point in the Set of Inline Handlers.\nTrying this again…Inline = Ordered?^?^? \n\nSo what is meant by \"Inline = Ordered?\"\nGood question.\n   - exchange with everyone who read the above section\n\nThe reason behind the addition of the other 2 types or modes of handlers is to provide\nspecific guarantees about when handlers will be called and how they will affect our\nSystems and Applications.\nThe meaning behind \"Inline = Ordered\" is that each Inline Handler will complete before the\nnext is called.  In other words, when adding 2 Inline Handlers to the TAO for the same\nApplication Context, whether the trigram for both is Concrete, Wildcard or they are added to\na combination of the two, only one Inline Handler will be executed to completion\nbefore the next is called.\nThis guarantee is true for all Inline Handlers even if the handler itself is an async\nfunction or returns a Promise.\nExample of ordering:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, async (tao, data) => {\n  console.log('First Inline Handler in, so I will be called first');\n  const users = await findUsersSomehow(data.Find);\n  return new AppCon('User', 'List', 'Portal', users); //  {\n  console.log('If no other total Wildcard handlers have been added, I will run third, after all handlers from the previously added trigram');\n});\n\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log('I have something else to do for this AppCon, and will run second'); // \nSpecial Note: In all likelihood, our App will register some type of Handler on the total\nWildcard trigram ({}) first during bootstrapping of the App, so the above scenario of it being\ncalled 3rd is unlikely and only here for illustrative purposes.\nChaining Inline Handlers\nIf you remember Chaining Handlers from the Basics guide, we can\nreturn an AppCon from our Inline Handler in order to \"chain\" Application Contexts to\nautomatically trigger the next Application Context on the TAO.\nWhen Inline Handlers are chaining (returning AppCons), the TAO will spool up all returned\nAppCons so that all Inline Handlers are completed per the above \nguarantee before it sets the Application Context to the returned AppCons.\nIf more than one Inline Handler returns an AppCon then each AppCon will set the Application\nContext on the TAO in the order in which they were received, mirroring the order in which\nthe Inline Handlers were called.\nChaining = Fanout\nBecause the TAO is designed so that calls to setCtx and setAppCtx do not block the caller,\nin the process of chaining Inline Handlers (either intially or for any single downstream\nAppCon handling), if the TAO receives multiple AppCons, it will not block on each AppCon\nbefore setting the Application Context to a second or more AppCon.\nThis means that registering multiple Inline Handlers to react to an Application Context and then\nreturning AppCons from more than one will operate as a Fan Out operation and not a\nSequential set of setting Application Contexts on the TAO.\nasync Functions as Inline Handlers\nBecause a lot of what is done in JavaScript relies on asynchronous operation, the TAO allows\nyou to add async functions or functions that return a Promise\n(both referred to as async functions) as Inline Handlers for Application Contexts.\nWhen we add an async function as an Inline Handler to the TAO, the TAO will\nawait for our handler to fully complete (resolve or reject) before moving onto the next\nhandler.\nThis ensures that all Inline Handlers operate with the same ordering guarantees\noutlined above regardless of whether the function needs to block on waiting for some other\nresource to complete.\nThere is no difference in the way the TAO operates between an async function versus a fuction\nthat just returns a Promise.\nError Handling\nAs mentioned in the Basics guide about Handlers throwing Errors,\nintial Inline Handlers that throw an Error will bubble the Error (not catch) to the\ncaller that is setting the Application Context on the TAO, e.g.:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  throw new Error('I can\\'t find Users now!');\n});\n\nTAO.setCtx('User', 'Find', 'Portal'); // \nDownstream Errors are Swallowed\nHowever, when an Inline Handler chains by returning an AppCon, the inner call to setting\nthe downstream Application Context using the chained AppCon will swallow any Errors that\nare raised.  This is provided by the TAO to ensure that downstream calls that may be\nunanticipated will not blow up your app, or stated otherwise, the TAO provides a guarantee\nof graceful degradation.\nThis is a specific design choice around a Functional Programming Principle to decouple\nknowledge and responsibility within Apps and Systems built using the TAO.\n"},"advanced/async-handlers.html":{"url":"advanced/async-handlers.html","title":"Async Handlers","keywords":"","body":"Async Handlers\nAsync Handlers provide us with the option of reacting to Application Contexts set on the TAO\nin a \"tangential\" asynchronous execution outside of the normal line.\nGenerally, this is used for creating side effects of the Application Context.\nAsync not async\nIn the TAO, Async Handlers are not async handlers, which are functions added\nto the TAO as handlers for Application Contexts which happen to operate using JavaScript\nPromises.\nDue to not implementing this library sooner (the original inception was before the async keyword\nexisted in C#) as well as not being able to think of a better word to capture its meaning, Async\nHandlers exist to provide a way to react to Application Contexts apart from Inline Handlers, out-of-band from a sequential set of operations.\nOrigins of Async Handlers\nThe original intent was specifically to provide execution on a separate thread when this was\nmore difficult and clumsy to code (in C# and Java), and give control of the main thread back\nto the caller.  Or, exactly what the async keyword itself has come to be for modern languages.\nAlthough the implementation of the TAO (which is now only in JavaScript, a language that is\n\"single-threaded\") has changed based on the changes in languages since its inception, the concept behind Async\nHandlers remains and provides a specific need when modeling Systems and Applications apart\nfrom the implemention details associated with asynchronous calls to network or other resources.\nThe underlying implementation of Async Handlers, while important, may change to get closer to\nthe ideal so you should not rely on how it is implemented now, rather rely on the interface and\nguarantees provided by the TAO's handling of Async Handlers.\nAsync = Out of Band\nThe purpose of Async Handlers is to allow our Systems and Apps to react to Application Contexts\nin a separate execution context apart from the one that set the Application Context on the TAO.\nWe call this out of band execution because the intent is that the main line of execution\nwill continue without regard for the Async Handler or its eventual conclusion.\nFrom an Event-based development perspective, Async Handlers provide a mechanism to fire off\nreactions and not care where they go or what they're doing and get back to the main line\nof execution (mostly captured using Inline Handlers).\nFor it's part, the TAO will execute each Async Handler within its own execution context ensuring\nthat any Inline Handlers are not affected by any Async Handlers.\nWhat makes for using an Async Handler?\nIt's tempting to use Async Handlers when deciding to make calls that would use an async function\n(or Promises).  However, that's not always the designed intent of Async Handlers.\nLet's use an example to illustrate fetching data from an API that needs to be rendered in a UI.\nFrom this example, this would be a sequence better modeled using Inline Handlers due to the\nordered nature of the operations along with Inline Handlers' ability to handle, block and chain\nusing async functions.\nDescribing Async Handlers for our Apps\nBased on the example above, because there's a very sequential ordering of Application Contexts\nto move the App from one State to the next, the handlers are better added to the TAO as\nInline Handlers rather than Async Handlers.\nWe want to use Async Handlers to react to Application Contexts when we need \"Out of Band\"\noperations.\nLet's use an example of bootstrapping our App on the front end when a user first comes to the\nHome Page.  We want to either fetch an existing Session or initialize a new Session, and we\nwant this to happen out of band so it doesn't block the User's experience of getting the Home Page.\nWe'll now add our Session to our previous example Use Case: User Enters the App\nin the Basics Defining Handlers guide:\nUse Case: User Enters the App\nFrom our earlier example, the intial Use Case of a User coming to the App, the AppCons we\ndefined and the handlers that need to perform:\nTAO-Path: Bootstrap Home Page\n\n\n\n#\nchain\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\nmode\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nOpen App\nApp\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ninitialize App data and prepare the UI\n\n\n1\n\nApp\nEnter\nPortal\n=>/a\nkick off getting User's Session by chaining to Bootstrap User Session\n\n\n2\n=>\nApp\nView\nPortal\n=>\nget the Portal's containing View and render it\n\n\n3\n=>\nSpace\nFind\nPortal\n=>\nfetch all of the Spaces from api\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nList\nPortal\n=>\nshow the Space List View in the Portal\n\n\n\nNotice the duplicated trigram ({App,Enter,Portal}) added to the table and new (=>/a ) mode\nsymbol.  The mode symbol is a way to distinguish handling an AppCon asynchronously (=>/)\nvs inline (=>), where the Async Handler can include a reference ( a ) to another TAO-Path\nor chained AppCon.\nIn the above table, we're stating that after the {App,Enter,Portal} AppCon, we want to both\nasynchronously kick off a search for the User's Session (Bootstrap User Sessiona ) and\ninline View the Portal (chained as => {App,View,Portal}).\nBecause Async Handlers create an out of band execution context, we separate the description\ninto a new table below.\nTAO-Path: Bootstrap User Session \n\n\n\n#\nchain\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\nmode\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\na:=>\nSession\nFind\nPortal\n=>\nfind the current Session for the Userif the Session isn't found, create a new one 1aif the Session is found, enter it 1b\n\n\n1\n\\1a:=>\nSession\nCreate\nPortal\n=>\ncreate a new Session then enter it 1b\n\n\n2\n\\1b:=>\nSession\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\nset the Session local to the App\n\n\n\nHere we see new chain symbols (\\xx:=>) describing a situation where the App may\nenter different Application Contexts depending on what the result of the previous handler is.\nIn this example, the {Session,Find,Portal} may or may not find a User Session, in which\ncase we want to communicate which AppCon is triggered depending on the outcome.\nThe backslash (\\) preceding the normal chain arrow (=>) denotes that the result will not fall\nthrough to the row below.\nTAO-Path: Refined Bootstrap User Session\nFinding a Session may also lead to fetching a User in order to personalize the App as well\nas fire off Tracking code for the visit.\n\n\n\n#\nchain\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\nmode\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\na2:/=>\nSession\nFind\nPortal\n=>\nfind the current Session for the Userif the Session isn't found, create a new one2aif the Session is found, enter it2b\n\n\n1\n\\2a:=>\nSession\nCreate\nPortal\n=>\ncreate a new Session then enter it2b\n\n\n2\n\\2b:=>\nSession\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\nset the Session local to the App\n\n\n3\n\nSession\nEnter\nPortal\n=>/\nupdate analytics tracking with Session data\n\n\n4\n+=>\nUser\nFind\nPortal\n=>/\nfetch the User in the Session from the api\n\n\n\nWhich would then lead to its own TAO-Path for Getting the User which we want out of band\nfrom the Bootstrap User Session TAO-Path.\nAdding Async Handlers to the TAO\nAdding Async Handlers to the TAO is similar to adding Inline Handlers, except we're\ngoing to call the addAsyncHandler method instead:\n// add Async Handler to trigger our out of band search for the User's Session by chaining\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  return new AppCon('Session', 'Find', 'Portal');\n});\n\n// add Async Handler to fetch a User when a Session is entered\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'Session', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  return new AppCon('User', 'Find', 'Portal', {\n    Find: { id: data.Session.userId }\n  });\n});\n\n// update tracking for user in external tracking system\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'Session', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  tracking.updateSession(data.Session, data.Portal);\n})\n\nAsync Handlers don't block\nBy their very definition, Async Handlers do not block the setCtx or setAppCtx calls\non the TAO.  The TAO will cycle through all of the handlers in the same order described\nin Inline Handlers Ordering but unlike\nInline Handlers, Async Handlers provide no guarantees around ordering.\nThe non-blocking means that if any of the handlers called within an Async Handler do\nuse a Promise, then another Async Handler execution context can take over execution.\nChaining Async Handlers\nOften, as seen in the examples above, an Async Handler is used to chain to a new\nset of AppCons by simply returning the new AppCon that will kick off the new\nTAO-Path within the new execution context that the TAO provides and do nothing else.\nThis is an effective way of utilizing Async Handlers to create a clear and meaningful\nfork in execution and should not be seen as \"cheating\" or excess verbosity.  The purpose\nbeing served is to provide relevant semantics to the desired logic of our App.\nWhen chaining by returning an AppCon from an Async Handler, the TAO will set\nthe AppCon within the execution context for the Async Handler.  Because each\nindividual Async Handler is executed within its own context, a whole new set of\nhandlers of all types can be executed within this execution context.\nError Handling - All Errors are Swallowed\nAsync Handlers differ from the other types in that because the TAO provides a new\nexecution context for them, to ensure the TAO can guarantee any code cannot\nunintentially blow up the App, the TAO will swallow any Errors thrown\nwithin the Async Handler or any downstream (chained) handlers.\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  throw new Error('I can\\'t find Users now!');\n});\n\nTAO.setCtx('User', 'Find', 'Portal'); // \n"},"advanced/intercept-handlers.html":{"url":"advanced/intercept-handlers.html","title":"Intercept Handlers","keywords":"","body":"Intercept Handlers\nThe last type of handler are Intercept Handlers.  These provide a similar capability to\nDOM-style Events preventDefault() capability, but bring it everywhere.\nIntercept Handlers are also crucial components for providing Aspect-Oriented Programming\n(AOP) capabilities to our\nprograms utilizing the TAO.\nLike Inline Handlers\nIntercept Handlers behave exactly like Inline Handlers, they are called one-by-one using\nthe same rules for ordering outlined there,\nwith the difference that Intercept Handlers react to the return value of the function\nset as the Intercept Handler.\nThe check against the return value of the Intercept Handler results in the following:\n\nA falsey value means the TAO\nwill continue to the next handler\nA truthy value means\nthe TAO will stop calling any more handlers - effectively intercepting all handlers\nwaiting for the current AppCon and downstream AppCons (chained) and handler calls\non them.\nAn AppCon - is considered truthy so it intercepts like above, plus the TAO\nwill set the context to the returned AppCon like chaining operates with other\ntypes of handlers.\n\nThe First will Intercept\nIf multiple Intercept Handlers are added that would fire for a single Application\nContext, then each will (as stated above) be called sequentially using the rules for\nordering Intercept Handlers.\nThe first handler that returns a truthy\nvalue will halt proceedings and if there were any remaining Intercept Handlers,\nthey will not be called.\nNo Signal Specifically\nThe TAO will not signal to the caller that an Intercept Handler has stopped the\npropogation of AppCons.  If this is something you need for a given Application\nContext, then return an AppCon from the handler function and pass the desired\ninformation within that context.\nDescribing Inline Handlers for our Apps\nUse Case: User Edits Space\nIn our Editing of a Space example, we want to add validation so that we don't\naccept and save data that makes the Space inconsistent with the defined data\nrules.\n\n\n\n#\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nUser hits edit\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>\nget the Space Edit form and put it in the UI\n\n\n1\nUser hits cancel\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n2\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>?!a\nis updated Space data valid?!validation errors\n\n\n3\n\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nsend updated Space data to the api\n\n\n3\n\\a:=>\nSpace\nFail\nPortal\n=>\nrender errors in Edit form\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in primary data store for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n5\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in cache for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n6\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nNotice the duplicated trigram ({Space,Update,Portal}) which now has 2 handlers, an Intercept\nHandler denoted by the (=>?!a ) and the Inline Handler (=>) it had before.  The\nIntercept Handler mode symbol is a way to denote that it presents a choice (?) to halt (!)\nfurther progression down the TAO-Path chain (and even to the next handler on the same AppCon) and\nset the direction to a different AppCon ( a ).\nThe logic of the choice being made by the Intercept Handler is detailed in the handler spec.\nThe new AppCon the Intercept Handler sets on the TAO is further down in the table identified\nby the reference anchor a: and surrounded by an interrupted chain trigger (\\{ref}:=>).  This symbol is used to denote that while normally a chain falls through to the next\nrow in the table (=>), this one is outside this flow (\\=>).\nIn the above table, we're stating that when the {Space,Update,Portal} AppCon is set, we want to\nfirst intercept the proceedings and check the validity of the data according some rules and\nconstraints, and if this check fails, divert to a different Application Context.  Otherwise, if\nthe check passes, continue to the next handler on {Space,Update,Portal} (in this case our Inline\nHandler which continues the TAO-Path chain).\nUse Case: Refined User Edits Space\nWe also want to ensure the User who makes the edits has the authorization to\ncomplete the edit of a Space.\n\n\n\n#\ntrigger\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nUser hits edit\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>?!b\ncan User edit Space ?!User unauthorized\n\n\n1\n\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>\nget the Space Edit form and put it in the UI\n\n\n2\nb:User unauthorized\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n3\nUser hits cancel\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n4\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>?!c\nis updated Space data valid?!validation errors\n\n\n5\n\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>?!b\ncan User edit Space ?!User unauthorized\n\n\n6\n\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nsend the updated Space data to the api\n\n\n7\n\\c:=>\nSpace\nFail\nPortal\n=>\nrender errors in Edit form\n\n\n8\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in primary data store for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n9\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in cache for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n10\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nAdding Intercept Handlers to the TAO\nAdding Intercept Handlers to the TAO is similar to adding Inline and Async Handlers, except we're\ngoing to call the, you guessed it, addInterceptHandler method instead:\n// add Intercept Handler to validate Space data during an Update\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  const validationErrors = isSpaceValid(data.Space, data.Update);\n  if (validationErrors) {\n    return new AppCon('Space', 'Fail', 'Portal', {\n      Space: data.Space,\n      Fail: {\n        on: tao.a,\n        Update: data.Update,\n        Errors: validationErrors\n      }\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nfunction checkUserAuthorizedToUpdateSpace(tao, { Space, Portal }) {\n  if (!isAuthorized(Portal.user, Space)) {\n    return new AppCon('Space', 'Enter', 'Portal', { Space, Portal });\n  }\n}\n\n// add Intercept Handlers to verify the User is authorized to Edit/Update a Space\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Edit', o: 'Portal' }, checkUserAuthorizedToUpdateSpace);\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, checkUserAuthorizedToUpdateSpace)\n\nChaining Intercept Handlers\nAs mentioned above, any return value from an Intercept Handler will\nhalt a chain, and an AppCon returned from an Intercept Handler will instruct the TAO to\nset thte context to that AppCon.\nBased on this, chaining with Intercept Handlers is very powerful in that it's the only way\nto intercept the proceeedings that gives the ability to signal the App to do something else.\nasync Functions as Intercept Handlers\nJust like with Inline Handlers,\nwe can use async functions or functions that return a\nPromise\n(both referred to as async functions) as an Intercept Handler.\nAlso, just like with Inline Handlers, the TAO will await for our handler to fully complete\n(resolve or reject) before moving onto the next handler.\nThis ensures that each Intercept Handler is called in order before the TAO moves to the\nnext.  This will also have more impact when we learn about the order of handlers.\nError Handling\nAs mentioned in the Basics guide about Handlers throwing Errors,\nintial Intercept Handlers that throw an Error will bubble the Error (not catch) to the\ncaller that is setting the Application Context on the TAO, e.g.:\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Edit', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  throw new Error('I can\\'t edit Spaces now! It\\'s too soon.');\n});\n\nTAO.setCtx('Space', 'Edit', 'Portal'); // \nDownstream Errors are Swallowed\nHowever, when an Intercept Handler chains by returning an AppCon, the inner call to setting\nthe downstream Application Context using the chained AppCon will swallow any Errors that\nare raised.  This is provided by the TAO to ensure that downstream calls that may be\nunanticipated will not blow up your app, or stated otherwise, the TAO provides a guarantee\nof graceful degradation.\nThis is a specific design choice around a Functional Programming Principle to decouple\nknowledge and responsibility within Apps and Systems built using the TAO.\n"},"advanced/order-of-handlers.html":{"url":"advanced/order-of-handlers.html","title":"Order of Operations","keywords":"","body":"Order of Operations\nThe TAO gives us 3 ways to handle Application Contexts using Intercept,\nAsync and Inline Handlers.\nThese 3 modes were chosen specifically to provide us with enough power to handle any case\nas well as flexibility to keep our code decoupled.\nNow that we understand what the TAO guarantees about each individual type of handler, to fully\ngrasp how to utilize the 3 to their best, we want to understand the guarantees the TAO provides\nfor how they all work together in the TAO.\nIntercept > Async > Inline\nPut simply, when an Application Context is set on the TAO, it will call all of the registered\nhandlers in the following precedence:\n\nIntercept Handlers - all called before calling…\nAsync Handlers - all called before calling…\nInline Handlers - all called before setting all AppCons chained from Inline Handlers\n\nIn this context \"all called\" translates to all handlers of a given type (Intercept, Async, or\nInline), no matter if the handler was added to a Concrete or Wildcard that matches the\nApplication Context that was set on the TAO.\nIn essence, what the TAO is doing is:\n\nFirst run a special set of handlers (Intercept) that can prevent both other handlers from\nbeing called as well as the execution of downstream TAO-Paths in the form of chaining\nto get the interrupt logic out of the way.  Once the App has made it passed these checks,\nkick off all out-of-band operations before running all of the normal operations used\nto implement the desired effect of setting the Application Context.\n\nIn other words, Intercept Handlers are Inline Handlers with 2 differences, they run\nfirst and they have the power to stop execution.  Inline Handlers cannot prevent any other\nhandlers from being called.  We have our special Inline Handlers as Intercept Handlers run\nfirst in order to provide guards that test the constraints of the App before making a\nstate transition.\nThe Async Handlers are called in the middle (after constraint checks but before regular)\nso that we don't block the desired side effects of our transition by the normal flow\nof execution of the regular (Inline) handlers.\nA further breakdown of the order of precedence (or operations) is that when the TAO is told\nthat our App has entered a specific Application Context, it gives our App code:\n\nfirst, a way to prevent any further activity\nsecond, a way to kick off important operations that we want to occur without blocking\nfinally, a way of executing the specific behavior we want to occur for this Application\nContext\n\nONLY Guaranteed Ordering by the TAO\nThis  represents the ONLY ordering guarantee provided by the TAO.\nThis is very important as it was specifically designed this way.  Ordering amongst handlers\nof the same type (or mode) should not be relied upon as handlers can be added and\nremoved dynamically throughout the course of our Apps executing.\nTo rely on order guarantees in our Apps, we use this stated ordering guarantee from the\nTAO and design/build our Apps to:\n\nuse the 3 different handler types to ensure ordered execution on a single Application\nContext\nuse different Application Contexts with chaining to ensure ordered execution of the\ndesired flow of operations\n\nFurther Uses of Intercept Handlers\nBecause the only way to guarantee a handler will be called first (or in the first group)\nis to add it to the TAO as an Intercept Handler, we will use these often for utility beyond\nsimply constraint checks.\nAn example is logging all Application Contexts set on the TAO during development.  As a\ntool, we can simply add a Wildcard Intercept Handler like this when bootstrapping our\nApp:\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({}, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`context set as {${tao.t},${tao.a},${tao.o}} with data:`, data);\n});\n\nBecause this Intercept Handler returns nothing, it won't have any downstream affect\non the execution of other handlers for all Application Contexts apart from the effect\nof logging to the console for each one.\nIn this way, Intercept Handlers provide a dual purpose on the TAO:\n\nProvide checks and guards (main intent)\nAllow injecting guarantee first execution for a handler\n\nInline Handlers are the Bread & Butter\nThat being said, Inline Handlers represent the bulk of what you want to be adding to\nthe TAO.  Most applications can be written with a very linear flow of operations which\nis what Inline Handlers were designed to tackle.\nIf you find yourself relying on Intercept Handlers to guarantee the order of operations,\nfirst ask:\n\nWould it be better to split the Application Context into more than one, and use\nchaining to order the operations?\n\nThis is what chaining was designed to accomplish, and why TAO-based Apps are built\nwith finer granularity of Application Contexts to represent states within an App\nthan what most expect coming from other programming paradigms.\nWhen it comes to Async Handlers, it's recommended to reserve their use to sets of\noperations which you want out of band from the expected flow in order to provide either:\n\na better User experience…or\nbetter performance……on\nan operation that isn't critical to the expected outcome of the specific Application\nContext.\n\n"},"advanced/promise-hook.html":{"url":"advanced/promise-hook.html","title":"Promise Hook","keywords":"","body":"tao.js Promise Hook\ntao.js, as an implementation of the TAO in JavaScript with a goal of being able to\nbe used everywhere.

The Trigram for each handler\nis defined using the term, action and orient props passed to the RenderHandler, and\nthe RenderHandler has a function as a child\nwith the exact same signature as any other TAO handler allowing us to return what we want\nrendered in the DOM tree when the corresponding AppCon has been encountered.\nAll Component handlers from the @tao.js/react package are added to the TAO as Inline Handlers.\nAny ommitted Trigram props (term, action or orient) will be treated as a wildcard\nwhen adding the handler to the TAO just like when adding any normal handler to the TAO.\nAdditionally, you'll notice the action prop used in the RenderHandler for the Form\ncomponent which provides an array of actions.  As a convenience, the RenderHandler (and all\nother Component handlers from the @tao.js/react package) will compute a cartesian product\nof all possible Trigrams from the Trigram prop values provided and add itself as a\nhandler for each of them.\nImproved Control with SwitchHandler\nRenderHandler components behave just like a normal TAO handler reacting to an AppCon but they\ndo not react to other AppCons to which they are not configured to handle.  In React terms, this\ntranslates to adding their children to the render tree once their configured AppCon has been\nencountered in the TAO, but not controlling removal.  This means the SpaceContainer we\ndefined above will progressively show each of our Space components as users interact with\nthe app, but none of these components will disappear.\nTo have the selective rendering behavior we need, we'll convert the SpaceContainer into\nusing a SwitchHandler to ensure only the desired space Components we want displayed are\nrendered and will be removed when the application has moved on from the configured AppCons.\nmodified src/components/space/index.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO, { AppCtx } from '@tao.js/core';\nimport {\n  SwitchHandler,\n  RenderHandler,\n} from '@tao.js/react';\nimport List from './list';\nimport View from './view';\nimport Form from './form';\n\n// chain entering a Space with showing the View\nTAO.addInlineHandler(\n  { t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  (tao, { Space }) => {\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'View', 'Portal', { Space });\n  }\n);\n\nconst SpaceContainer = props => (\n  {/* surround RenderHandlers with a SwitchHandler */}\n  \n    Spaces\n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n    \n      {() => You must save for changes to take effect.}\n    \n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceContainer;\n\nThe SwitchHandler is now providing control over its child RenderHandlers by determining\nbased on the AppCons it sees which should be included in the render tree.\nTo reduce verbosity, the SwitchHandler accepts Trigram props that act as default Trigram\nprops for all child RenderHandlers and will be passed into the child RenderHandlers when\nthey're added to the render tree.  If a Trigram prop is defined by both, the RenderHandler's\nvalue will override the SwitchHandler's value both in determining the Trigram of the TAO\nhandler the SwitchHandler uses and on the RenderHandler component added to the render\ntree.\nThe configuration of surrounding RenderHandlers with a SwitchHandler is to provide\nexclusivity aka selection around which RenderHandlers to display.  It isn't necessary\nfor all RenderHandlers to be surrounded by a SwitchHandler, especially if the children\nof the RenderHandler can control their own display (like we'll see with the ErrorMessage.\nThe SwitchHandler only manages selective rendering for RenderHandler direct children,\nmeaning any descendant RenderHandlers are unaffected by an ancestor SwitchHandler.  It\nalso means the SwitchHandler will render any other children (Components or text) into the\ntree (e.g. the h2 title will always be in the render tree as long as the SpaceContainer\nis in the render tree).\nGetting data from AppCons into Components\nUsing withContext HOC\nThe withContext Higher-Order Component can be used to turn any React Component into a\nTAO handler that will receive data from an AppCon when it is encountered.\nAs a very simple example, say we want to have a welcome message for users of the app.\nsrc/components/shared/Welcome.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { withContext } from '@tao.js/react';\n\nconst Welcome = ({ data }) => (\n  Welcome{data.user ? ', ' + data.user.displayName : ' to Mypos'}!\n);\n\nexport default withContext(\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  { user: null }\n)(Welcome);\n\nThe withContext HOC wraps our Welcome component to provide the User data when it\nis encountered during a {User,Enter,Portal} AppCon.\nThe first arg to withContext defines the Trigram that our handler will be looking for.\nThe second arg to withContext is the TAO handler that will be called when the matching\nAppCon is set on the TAO with a variation from a standard TAO handler: you can return a\nvalue that will be used to determine the shape of the data prop that withContext\nwill pass to the Welcome component.\nThe third optional arg to withContext is used to set the default value of the data\nprop before any AppCons are encountered.\nNow our global header or App component can import the default export from src/components/shared/welcome.js\nand embed it in the page within a Provider and it'll just work like any other React Component.\nsrc/App.js with Welcome\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\nimport { Provider } from '@tao.js/react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport './App.css';\nimport SpaceContainer from './components/space';\nimport Welcome from './components/shared/welcome';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nThe withContext HOC has much more flexibility that you can find in the doc page.\nUsing DataHandlers for shared state\nDataHandlers provide a way to wire up TAO handlers into your React Component tree that capture\ndata and make it available to child and decendant components down the hierarchy.\nThe Provider sets up the initial data context as a map, and DataHandlers will modify that map\nwhen they react to their configured AppCons.\nLet's say we want to classify Spaces using a type field so we need a list of types as a\nlookup.  We'll modify our SpaceContainer to capture this list and make it available to it's\nchildren.\nsrc/components/space/index.js with types\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO, { AppCtx } from '@tao.js/core';\nimport {\n  SwitchHandler,\n  RenderHandler,\n} from '@tao.js/react';\nimport List from './List';\nimport View from './View';\nimport Form from './Form';\n\n// chain entering a Space with showing the View\nTAO.addInlineHandler(\n  { t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  (tao, { Space }) => {\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'View', 'Portal', { Space });\n  }\n);\n\n// fetch the SpaceTypes when we enter the App\nTAO.addAsyncHandler(\n  { t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  () => new AppCtx('SpaceType', 'Find', 'Portal'),\n);\n\nconst SpaceContainer = props => (\n  {/* Surround our tree with our DataHandler */}\n   data.SpaceTypes}\n  >\n    \n      Spaces\n      \n        {(tao, data) => }\n      \n      \n        {(tao, data) => }\n      \n      \n        {() => You must save for changes to take effect.}\n      \n      {/* Reference the DataHandler's data using the `context` prop */}\n      \n        {/* the context we referenced will augment the handler with args passing the data */}\n        {(tao, data, spaceTypes) => (\n          {/* pass the spaceTypes into the Form via the types prop */}\n          \n        )}\n      \n      \n        {(tao, data) => }\n      \n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceContainer;\n\nAbove we've added a few changes to our space/index.js and SpaceContainer component without\nhaving to create new components or new files.\nFirst, we add a new Async Handler to fetch the SpaceTypes lookup data when entering the app.\nNext we add a DataHandler component to react to the {SpaceType,List,Portal} AppCon which\nwill be triggered when successfully fetching the SpaceTypes from the backend.  The DataHandler's\nhandler is defined to return just the list of SpaceTypes in the AppCon data, which then sets\nthat value in the data context from the closet ancestor Provider in the component hierarchy using\nthe name prop of the DataHandler (in this case 'spaceTypes').\nWe get access to this data lower down in the hierarchy when we define the context prop on the\nRenderHandler surrounding our space Form (context=\"spaceTypes\").  When we add the context\nprop to the RenderHandler, it finds the data in the data context under the key(s) [multiple\ncontexts may be provided using an Array of context names - see the RenderHandler docs]\nand append that data as args to the handler used as the function as a child\nof the RenderHandler (if multiple contexts are provided, then each is appended as an arg in\nthe order in which they're listed in the prop value).\nFinally, in the function as a child prop of the\nRenderHandler we capture the spaceTypes arg and pass it to the Form component as the value of\nthe types prop.\n"},"client-react/provider.html":{"url":"client-react/provider.html","title":"Provider","keywords":"","body":"@tao.js/react Provider Component\nThe first Component we use as part of the declarative React API to integrate tao.js is the\nProvider component.

This is done by either ommitting the trigram key for the desired wildcard\nor by providing an empty string (\"\") as the prop value.\nAdditionally, as a convenience provided in the @tao.js/react package, using withContext we can\nspecify multiple values for any Trigram key to capture more than one specific AppCon (remember,\na wildcard will match any).

The handler function will be called like all other TAO handlers when an AppCon matching\nthe trigram(s) defined in the first arg to withContext is set on the TAO.\nIt is not possible to use the withContext function to create an HOC for wrapping React\nComponents without providing a function as the second (handler) arg to withContext.  This is\nbecause it doesn't make any sense to define an HOC using withcontext that has no handler.  If the\nhandler arg is not provided, and Error will be thrown.\nHowever, unlike a standard TAO Inline Handler function where all return values that are not an\ninstance of an AppCtx used for chaining are ignored, the HOC created\nusing withContext is using the handler function to set the value used for the data prop on\nthe Component it is wrapping, which provides the following behaviors:\n\nif the return value is not an instance of AppCtx from @tao.js/core, then the value\nwill be shallow merged with the existing value for the data prop on the wrapped Component\nif the return value from the handler function is an instance of AppCtx from @tao.js/core,\nit will be returned to the TAO and used to set the context on the TAO as an AppCon chain\nif there is no return value, the existing value will be used for the data prop on the wrapped\nComponent\n\nLet's dive into usage with these behaviors below.\nUsing the handler to return data\nThe first behavior mentioned above is returning a value that is not an instance of an AppCtx\nfrom @tao.js/core.  This is the primary usage scenario when using withContext so we'll tackle\nit first.\nWhen defining the handler function, whatever value is returned will be shallow merged with the\nexisting data to generate the data prop added to the wrapped Compoonent.  This shallow merging is\nintentional to mimic the behavior of React's Component.setState in order to allow the HOC to modify\nand maintain its state based on varying and different context brought about by multiple AppCons as\nthey are set over time.\nHere's a simple example we've already seen:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  …\n);\n\nFrom this example, when the {User,Enter,Portal} AppCon is set on the TAO, the HOC handler will\nbe called with that trigram as the tao arg and whatever data has been set with the AppCon.  In\nour handler's case, it's looking for the data.User (from the term) and returning an object with\nthat User data set as the user key.  The wrapped component will receive a data prop with the\nshape:\n{ user: … }\n\nLeveraging the Merging of Data\nSuppose we need our handler to handle more than one AppCon like:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: ['User', 'Role'], a: ['Enter', 'Leave'], o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => {\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      return tao.t === 'User' ? { user: undefined } : { role: undefined };\n    }\n    if (tao.t === 'User') {\n      return { user: data.User };\n    }\n    return { role: data.Role };\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nFrom this example, our handler is able to only have to return the portion of the state it\nneeds to change in relation to the AppCon that is being handled.  When the {User,Leave,Portal}\nis set on the TAO, it's resetting the user key in the state as opposed to when the\n{Role,Leave,Portal} has been set, the role key is reset in the state, and so forth.\nWe expect the data prop of the wrapped component to have the shape:\n{\n  user: …,\n  role: …\n}\n\nThird (set) and Fourth (current) args to handler\nThere may be situations, and we'll see one below where we\nwant to set the state for the data prop within the handler function rather than rely on\nthe return value and the shallow merging behavior above.\nFor these cases, the handler function has 2 additional args passed to it when called which differs\nfrom a standard TAO handler:\n\nset is a function that takes a single arg and sets the data prop state to whatever value\nis passed in that arg\ncurrent is the current data prop state\n\nThis allows us to have more flexibility and control with the logic we provide in our handler\nfunction to withContext, specifically:\nset arg\nUsing the set function passed as the third arg to our handler function, we have the ability\nto set the complete state of the data prop for our wrapped component.  Using this we bypass\nthe shallow merging behavior described above which is done as a\nconvenience for the majority of use cases.\nInstead of shallow merging the state like when we return a value from the handler function, using\nthe function from the set arg will set the state of the data prop to the object passed into\nthe set arg function.\nAs an example, we'll create an HOC that manages the roles a user can have within our app:\nconst RolesHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: ['User', 'Role'], a: ['Enter', 'Leave'], o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data, set, current) => {\n    const updatedData = {\n      roles: new Set(current.roles),\n    };\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      if (tao.t === 'User') {\n        updatedData.roles.clear();\n      }\n      else {\n        updatedData.roles.delete(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    else {\n      if (tao.t === 'Role') {\n        updatedData.role.add(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    set(updatedData);\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nFor our RolesHOC we need to keep track of the roles that the user is entering and leaving and\nmake them accessible to wrapped components.  To do this, we are managing the state of roles data\nusing a Set so we can't return an object with a roles key that will be shallow merged with the\nexisting state object.\ncurrent arg\nYou can see in the example above illustrating the use of the set arg that the fourth\narg is the current value of the state of the data prop.  This is passed so that we can make use\nof this value when setting or updating the state.\ncurrent can also be used when returning an object to shallow merge state in circumstances where\nthe existing state can determine the future state of our data prop.\nCalling set prevents shallow merge\nSo that there isn't any confusion or conflicting behavior, if the function in the set arg to\nour handler function is called, this call prevents any shallow merging of returned data from the\nhandler function.\nIf data is returned from the handler function and the function in the set arg was called during\nexecution of the handler function, the data will not be used to shallow merge with the current\nstate of the data prop.\nUsing the handler to chain to another AppCon\nBecause the handler provided to the withContext HOC generating function is to be a TAO handler,\nthe capability to chain to another AppCon works like a standard TAO handler in that if the handler\nfunction passed as the second arg to withContext returns an instance of an AppCtx from the\n@tao.js/core package, then that will be returned to the TAO to chain onto that AppCon by setting\nit in the TAO.\nAdditionally, the shallow merge will not occur in the state of the data prop in the withContext\ncreated HOC.\nModifying state data AND chaining\nBecause it may be desired to both update the state of the data prop passed to the wrapped\ncomponent AND chain to another AppCon by returning an AppCtx, we can use the set (3rd) arg to our\nhandler function to set the state of the data prop and still return an AppCtx.\nExtending our example from above regarding using the set arg function:\nconst RolesHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: ['User', 'Role'], a: ['Enter', 'Leave'], o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data, set, current) => {\n    const updatedData = {\n      roles: new Set(current.roles),\n    };\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      if (tao.t === 'User') {\n        updatedData.roles.clear();\n      }\n      else {\n        updatedData.roles.delete(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    else {\n      if (tao.t === 'Role') {\n        updatedData.role.add(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    set(updatedData);\n    // chain to a new AppCon that is the same as the current AppCon w/ orient=Reporting\n    return new AppCtx(tao.t, tao.a, 'Reporting', data);\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nReturn nothing from the handler\nIn our third behavior, we have returning nothing (undefined or null) from our handler function.\nThe effect this has on our execution is that if nothing is returned, then nothing will happen or\nchange the data prop state.  Additionally, this will not trigger a re-render of our withContext\nHOC because it will not call setState on the wrapping component.\nThis gives us the option within our handler function to determine whether there is a need for a\nre-render or not, and return something to that effect.\nFrom our RolesHOC example above, in the case of an AppCon with trigram {User,Enter,Portal},\nthe handler function doesn't return anything explicitly (essentially undefined is returned) and\ndoes not call the function from the set (3rd) arg to the handler function, so it will not trigger\na re-render of the component or its children.\nSetting the Default Value\nThe third arg to the withContext function is how we set the default value for the state of the\ndata prop before any matching AppCons are set in the TAO.\nThe default arg can be either:\n\nan Object which will be used to initialize default state for the data prop\na Function that returns an Object that when called will be used to initialize the state for\nthe data prop\n\nRepeating our very first example above:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  // third arg is a default value or function for the data prop\n  { user: null },\n);\n\nIn the above example, our default (3rd) arg to the withContext function is is initializing the\nstate of the data prop to:\n{\n  user: null\n}\n\nIt could just as easily be written using a Function with the exact same result:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  // third arg is a default value or function for the data prop\n  () => ({ user: null })\n);\n\n"},"client-react/data-handler.html":{"url":"client-react/data-handler.html","title":"DataHandler","keywords":"","body":"@tao.js/react DataHandler Component\nA React Component that will register as a handler for a TAO trigram in order to set data in a\nshared data context from its nearest ancestor Provider.

Each DataHandler must\ndefine a name key used to distinguish the data it is putting in this shared data context.\nThis name is used by the RenderHandler's context prop\nas a way to find the data the DataHandler is adding to the shared data context and make it\navailable to teh RenederHandler's children via its function as a child.\n\n\nIn the example above, all data manipulated by the DataHandler component will be in the shared\ndata context on the \"user\" key.\nDefining the handler Trigram\nUse the term, action and orient props on the DataHandler to define the Trigram the handler\nis listening for.\n\n\nDefining Multiple Trigrams\nJust like with a standard TAO handler, it's possible to use wildcard definitions for the Trigram\nof our DataHandler.  This is done by either ommitting the Trigram prop for the desired wildcard\nor by providing an empty string (\"\") as the prop value.\nAdditionally, as a convenience provided in the @tao.js/react package, all components can specify\nmultiple values for any Trigram prop to capture more than one specific AppCon (remember, a\nwildcard will match any).  This is done using an Array of values for the prop, e.g.:\n\n\nWhen a Trigram prop on a DataHandler has more than one value, the DataHandler will calculate\nthe cartesian product to determine all of the Trigrams to which the handler should be attached.\nUsing the above example code, that DataHandler would attach a handler to the following Trigrams\non the TAO:\n\n{User,Enter,Portal}\n{User,Leave,Portal}\n{Role,Enter,Portal}\n{Role,Leave,Portal}\n\nDefining the handler Function\nUnlike the RenderHandler, the DataHandler handler is defined using the\nhandler prop.  The handler prop expects a function that has the same signature as a TAO handler,\nplus a few extra args to work for the purpose design of the DataHandler to provide data to\ncomponents below it.\nSince the DataHandler component and the withContext function use the same\nunderlying implementation, for a full description of how the handler function behaves, please\nreview the withContext handler function docs for\nall of the particulars and behaviors.\n   data.User} // \n    …\n  \n\nThe handler prop function will also be called with set and current args\njust like the withContext handler function.\nThere is only a single difference between the DataHandler handler prop and the withContext\nhandler function:\nNot required\nThe handler prop is not required on a DataHandler. Whereas the withContext function will\nthrow an Error if the handler arg is not a Function, the DataHandler component will treat a\nmissing handler prop as the identity function.  In that way, if the handler function is not\ndefined, then whatever data value would be passed to the handler function upon a matching AppCon\nbeing set on the TAO, the same data will be used to set the value of the name key\nin the shared data context as if that data was the return value of the handler function (i.e.\na shallow merge will take place).\nInitializing the state with the default prop\nBefore any AppCons matching the trigram props defined on the DataHandler are set on the TAO,\nwe can initialize the value for the name key in the shared data context using the default\nprop.\n   data.User}\n    default={null} // \n    …\n  \n\nConsuming shared state provided by the DataHandler\nRenderHandlers are the components that consume the data provided by the DataHandler to the\nshared data context.\nPlease take a look at the RenderHandler consuming shared state docs\nfor more about this topic.\nMounting and Unmounting\nThe DataHandler has a particular relationship with the React Component Lifecycle that is\nimportant to understand when using it.\nWhen a DataHandler is mounted, that is when the name key in the shared data context is\ninitialized.\nWhen a DataHandler is unmounted, the name key in the shared data context is removed\nfrom the shared data context.\nname conflicts\nIf 2 different DataHandlers are the descendants of the same Provider and\nalso share the same name prop, then there will be conflicts with that name key in\nthe shared data context.  Specifically, if one of the DataHandlers mounts after the other,\nthen the name key will be initialized by that DataHandler over what previously was set\nby the first DataHandler.\nAdditionally, if one of the DataHandlers gets unmounted when the other is not, then the name\nkey and its value will be removed from the shared data context.\n"},"client-react/orig-api/":{"url":"client-react/orig-api/","title":"Original API","keywords":"","body":"Original Usage with React.js\nThis is a description of the first (\"original\") API for integrating the TAO with React.\nFor a description of the Current API which provides a more React-like declarative approach,\ntake a look here.\nIt's assumed you have read and are familiar with the Basics guide.\nIf not, then please go back and read through that before trying to learn how to use tao.js\nwith React.\nWhile tao.js itself is client-agnostic, we provide packages to make it\nseemlessly work with client UI libraries and frameworks.\nTo start we only have an implementation for React.js.\nUpcoming and asking for volunteers to help with packages to integrate:\n\nVue.js\nAngular.js\nEmber.js\nOther UI frameworks (please help)\n\ntao.js works seamlessly well with React given the philosophy of building\nreactive applications at the heart of building applications with tao.js.\nTo work with React, we make sure to install the @tao.js/react package:\nnpm install --save @tao.js/core @tao.js/react\n\n@tao.js/core is listed as a peerDependency for the react package so you\nmust install that as well or the package won't work.\nThere are 2 items we will import and work with to integrate tao.js within our\nReact UI:\n\nAdapter - a class that turns our React Components into\nHandlers for AppCons\nReactor - a React Component that uses a Adapter to react to\nAppCons in order to render your React Components into the UI\n\nExample\nHere's a simple example of using a Adapter and Reactor to control display of Components\nin the UI.  We'll use the same Example Application\nto illustrate integrating React here.\nExample Directory Structure\nPart of the Application deals with Spaces so it has the following directory:\nsrc/\n+- components/\n   +- Space/\n      - index.js\n      - ErrorMessage.js\n      - Form.js\n      - List.js\n      - View.js\n- App.css\n- App.js\nDefining React Components\nThe Component definitions for ErrorMessage, Form, List and View define basic\nReact Components (both functional and class) and are not aware of nor dependent upon\nthe @tao.js/react package.\nThey are making use of the TAO export from @tao.js/core in\norder to set the Application Context.\nsrc/components/space/List.js\nHere is an example of functional Components:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\nconst SpaceItems = ({ spaces }) =>\n  spaces.map(s => (\n    \n      \n          TAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, { Space: s })\n        }\n      >\n        {s.name}\n      \n    \n  ));\n\nconst SpaceList = ({ Space }) => (\n  \n    Current list of Spaces\n    \n       TAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'New', o: 'Portal' })}>\n        New\n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceList;\n\nsrc/components/space/Form.js\nHere is an example full Component for a simple form used to Edit a Space or Create\na new Space.\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\nclass SpaceForm extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = Object.assign(\n      {\n        name: '',\n        description: ''\n      },\n      props.Space\n    );\n  }\n\n  handleChange = event => {\n    const target = event.target;\n    const val = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value;\n    const name = target.name;\n    this.setState({\n      [name]: val\n    });\n  };\n\n  handleSubmit = event => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    const { a, Space:origSpace } = this.props;\n    const updatedSpace = this.state;\n    const isNew = a === 'New';\n    const saveAction = isNew ?

You\ncould say that Adapter and Reactor are the yin & yang ☯ of @tao.js/react (couldn't resist).\nOne of the stark differences to notice however is that the Adapter itself is not a\nComponent, but it does provide it's attached Components to the Reactor.\nAdapting React Components to be Handlers\nThe purpose of the Adapter is to convert our React Components into handlers for the TAO.\nBecause React Components are functions in JavaScript, we can take advantage of this to make this\nadaptation easy.\nThe Adapter will work on any React Component, however we will generally design our\nComponents to take advantage of the props passed to them as adapted from the tao\nand data args passed to handlers by the TAO when an Application Context is set.\nFluent Methods\nThe Adapter provides fluent method chaining for all of the public methods that we use\non the Adapter by returning a reference to the Adapter itself from these methods.  For those\nunfamiliar, fluent method chaining allows us to make a sequence of calls to the Adapter in a\nsingle statement, like:\nadapter\n  .setDefaultCtx({ t: 'Space', o: 'Portal' })\n  .addComponentHandler({ a: 'View' }, View)\n  .addComponentHandler({ a: 'List' }, List);\n\nImporting Adapter\nFirst, before using the Adapter it must be imported along with the TAO which is the argument\npassed to the Adapter's constructor:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\nimport { Adapter } from '@tao.js/react';\n\nOR\nconst TAO = require('@tao.js/core');\nconst { Adapter } = require('@tao.js/react');\n\nUsing a Component as a Handler\nUsing a Component as a handler for an Application Context is easy.\nInstead of calling the regular add[Type]Handler passing a handler function like:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  // do something here\n});\n\nWe create an Adapter and use the addComponentHandler method passing along our React Component\nlike:\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter.addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent);\n\nWhen we do this, the Adapter adds an Inline Handler to the TAO\nthat will be called when the {Space,View,Portal} Application Context is set on the TAO.\nWhen this occurs (the AppCon is set to what we're listening for), the Adapter will make the\nComponent its current component for rendering by the Reactor which is itself a\nComponent that will handle rendering our Component as its child.\ntao and data handler args combined as props\nWhen the adapted handler receives the call from the TAO, it keeps track of the tao and data\nargs passed to it so they can be included as props for our instantiated Component.\nHowever, since props is a single arg passed to the constructor of our Component, they have\nto be combined.  Although technically it's the Reactor that is managing this, it's useful for\nthe explanation here in order to understand how other options to the addComponentHandler and\nother methods on the Adapter will instantiate our Components to help us in designing and\ncreating our Components for use in this way.\nThe tao and data objects are merged to create the props on our Component so that we\nat least end up with the following props passed to our Component:\n\nt: string - the t from the tao trigram arg represents the Term\na: string - the a from the tao trigram arg represents the Action\no: string - the o from the tao trigram arg represents the Orient(ation)\n[term]: any (optional) - the [term] key is the value of t and the value is the\nvalue of the data in the AppCon that is related to the Term (from data arg)\n[action]: any (optional) - the [action] key is the value of a and the value\nis the value of the data in the AppCon that is related to the Action (from data arg)\n[orient]: any (optional) - the [orient] key is the value of o and the value\nis the value of the data in the AppCon that is related to the Orient(ation) (from data arg)\n\nClearing the Component on an AppCon\nSometimes we may want to explicitly clear the Component when an Application Context is set on\nthe TAO.  The Adapter allows us to set a \"Component handler\" for an empty component by passing\nan empty or omitting the second argument to addComponentHandler:\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'List', o: 'Portal' }, null)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Edit', o: 'Portal' }); // equivalent to above\n\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, Space); // \nRemoving a ComponentHandler\nJust like you can remove a handler from the TAO, the Adapter allows you to remove a Component\nhandler by using removeComponentHandler.  Because you will generally not add a Component\nhandler with an anonymous inline function, it's likely you will easily have a reference to the\nComponents constructor even if that reference is imported.\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter.addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent);\n…\n// somehwere else\nadapter.removeComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent);\n\nRemove ALL ComponentHandler call\nAs a convenience, the Adapter allows you to remove all trigrams attached to a Component\nhandler by passing an empty first argument to the removeComponentHandler method:\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Admin' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'List', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'List', o: 'Admin' }, MyComponent);\n…\n// somehwere else\nadapter.removeComponentHandler({}, MyComponent); // \nSpecial Note: as an individual Adapter is managing the handler functions added to the TAO,\nthis way of removing handlers is scoped only to the individual Adapter.\nSuccinct ComponentHandlers\nThe Adapter provides 2 mechanisms to reduce the verbosity when working with Component handlers.\nMatrixed trigrams\nBecause we may want to use the same Component to handle several different Application Contexts,\nthe Adapter allows the trigram values to be Arrays to capture a matrix of trigrams to handle\nby our Component.  When using this mechanism, the Adapter will use the ternary Cartesian Product\nof all possibilities and add handlers to the TAO for each.\nimport Form from './Form';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter.addComponentHandler({ term: 'Space', action: ['New', 'Edit'], orient: 'Portal' }, Form);\n\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'New', o: 'Portal' }); // \nDefault Context\nBecause we will usually use a single Adapter to manage a set of Components for our React App\nin some area of similarity, the Adapter allows setting the default context used by an Adapter\nto avoid repetitive setting of the same aspects when adding or removing Component handlers.\nThere are 2 ways to set the default context:\n\ndefaultCtx setter property\nsetDefaultCtx method which is fluent chainable by returning a reference to the Adapter\nyou've seen this used in the Intro to @tao.js React examples\n\nAdditionally, the Adapter has a getter property defaultCtx which returns a copy of the\nvalue of the default context set by one of the methods above so that it cannot be modified outside\nof the Adapter.\nWhen using the default context, the Adapter will perform an Object.assign on the default\ncontext and the specific trigram used in the add or remove call so that trigram aspects passed in\nto the specific add or remove invocation will overwrite the default when determining the trigram\nthat is of interest.  This applies to matrix trigrams as well, and the cartesian product will be\ndetermined after the merge has taken place.\nWe can use the defualt context to clean up examples from above:\nimport View from './View';\nimport Form from './Form';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter\n  .setDefaultCtx({ t: 'Space', o: 'Portal' })\n  .addComponentHandler({ a: 'View' }, View)\n  .addComponentHandler({ a: 'List' }, null)\n  .addComponentHandler({ a: ['New', 'Edit'] , Form});\n\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, Space); // \nAdditional props\nThe Adapter allows us to pass additional props that will be added to our Components when\nthey are instantiated in the UI by the Reactor.\nTo do this, we pass an Object with the desired props values in the third argument to\naddComponentHandler:\nimport Form from './Form';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter.addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: ['New', 'Edit'], o: 'Portal' }, Form, {\n  successCtx: { t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }\n});\n\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'New', o: 'Portal' }); // \nAddtional props specific to handler\nBecause we assign the additional props when adding the Component handler, the props assignment\nwe are making are particular to when that ComponentHandler is called.\nWe have 3 options to make them more general and not have to repeat them:\n\nAdd Component handlers with matrixed trigrams\nUse default context\nUse the Reactor's additional props which only count for children\nrendered by that Reactor and will not be assigned for all Component handlers of our\nAdapter when more than one Reactor is used with the Adapter\n\nSpecial Note: it should be rather easy to add a defaultProps feature to Adapter allowing\nthis to have another option.  If that seems a need, we can do it.\n"},"client-react/orig-api/reactor.html":{"url":"client-react/orig-api/reactor.html","title":"Reactor","keywords":"","body":"tao.js Reactor for React\nThis is a description for part of the first (\"original\") API for integrating the TAO with React.\nFor a description of the Current API which provides a more React-like declarative approach,\ntake a look here.\nNow that we know how to use Adapters to use our React Components as handlers for\nApplication Contexts in the TAO, we need to learn how to render them in the UI.\n@tao.js/react provides the Reactor Component to accomplish this by working with the Adapters\nwe create.\nNot much here to see\nReactor components are specifically designed to be simple to use dumb container components that\nwill render whatever is determined by the TAO via the Adapter to which it is attached.\nTo use a Reactor we will need to import it as well as have access to (or import and create) an\nAdapter.  It's usual to create them together, allowing all of our other Component definitions\nused by the Adapter to be isolated and defined on their own where they can be regular React\nComponents without any knowledge of either the Adapter or Reactor.\nHere's an example of creating and setting up an Adapter and then attaching a Reactor to it:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\nimport { Adapter, Reactor } from '@tao.js/react';\n// import child components that will be handlers\nimport List from './List';\nimport View from './View';\nimport Form from './Form';\n\nconst spaceAdapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nspaceAdapter\n  .setDefaultCtx({ term: 'Space', orient: 'Portal' })\n  .addComponentHandler({ action: 'List' }, List)\n  .addComponentHandler({ action: 'View' }, View)\n  .addComponentHandler({ action: ['New', 'Edit'] }, Form);\n\nconst SpaceContainer = () => (\n  \n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceContainer;\n\nadapter is required\nThe adapter prop on the Reactor component is required and must be of type Adapter.\nIt's possible to make an interface out of this and allow more flexiblity but we don't see the point\nright now.\nMore details\nWhen a Reactor is created, it first registers itself with the adapter defined in it's props to\nbe notified when the Adapter's adapted handlers have been called by the TAO so that the Reactor\ncan trigger React to render itself, specifically its child Component.\nThe child Component of a Reactor is the component that is currently set for the Adapter.  This\nis why we won't have a single global Adapter like we do for the TAO, rather each Adapter is\nacting as a publisher for any Reactors that care to subscribe for components.\nadapter is a prop\nBecause adapter is a prop to the Reactor, it is possible to change the adapter on the fly.\nAlthough the Reactor is written to be simple, it's not so dumb as we make it.  If you do change\nthe adapter prop, it will check to see if it is different before unregistering from the previous\nand registering with the new Adapters for updates.\nAdditionally, when the Reactor is unmounted, it will unregister itself so as not to receive\nmore updates from the Adapter, allowing it to be garbage collected having no references leaking.\nchildren are ignored\nThe Reactor is designed to render child Components based on what Application Contexts are set\non the TAO via the Adapter to which it is attached.  Currently, any child Components of a\nReactor will be ignored and not rendered as part of the UI.\nexport function MyContainer() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        {/* everything below is ignored */}\n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nIf it makes sense, this could be revisited in the future.\nAdditional props\nJust like the Adapter's additional props, Reactors can be\ngiven props beyond the required adapter to make it work.\nexport function MyContainer() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nAdapter's additional props are assigned when the Component handler is added, so the props\nbecome default for a particular Component when a particular AppCon is set on the TAO.\nThis differs from Reactor additional props in that whatever is set on the Reactor Component\nas props will be passed down to the instantiated child Component.\nThink of Reactor additional props as global to the possible children of the Reactor.\nIf there is conflict and a prop is defined for both a Reactor and Adapter's Component\nhandler, the Component handler's prop coming from the Adapter will take precedence and be used\nto set the value of the prop on the child Component.\nSpecial Note: because these additional props are set on the Reactor and not the\nAdapter and that Reactors attach themselves to their adapters, the Adapter has no knowledge\nand never sees the additional props coming from a Reactor.\n"},"server-side/":{"url":"server-side/","title":"Using Server-side","keywords":"","body":"Using tao.js Server-side\nOne of the goals of tao.js is a unified programming paradigm across all execution environments.\nWhile you can utilize the library easily in your server-side applications, use these packages\nto make the implementation seamless and easy:\n\nSocket.io - easily integrate tao.js with Socket.io on\nClient & Server for seamless tao.js programming across an entire application\nKoa Middleware - coming soon\nConnect/Express Middlware - coming soon\n\n"},"server-side/socket-io.html":{"url":"server-side/socket-io.html","title":"Socket.io","keywords":"","body":"tao.js for Socket.io\nIt's assumed you have read and are familiar with the Basics guide.\nIf not, then please go back and read through that before trying to learn how to use tao.js\nwith React.\nSocket.io is the recommended way to make our server-side code run with the TAO because of their\nmutual affinity.  Socket.io espouses an Event-driven paradigm that spans server and client as\nopposed to the Request-Reply paradigm of traditional HTTP servers.\ntao.js offers the @tao.js/socket.io package making it seemless to use Socket.io to bridge the TAO\nacross Client and Server.\nTo install @tao.js/socket.io, use:\nnpm install --save @tao.js/core socket.io @tao.js/socket.io\n\nOR\nyarn add @tao.js/core socket.io @tao.js/socket.io\n\n@tao.js/core is (like in all other tao.js packages) a peerDependency required to make @tao.js/socket.io work.\nSocket.io is a peerDependency rather than a direct dependency of @tao.js/socket.io to keep the\nsize of the package small when it's used on the client.\nImporting\n@tao.js/socket.io is designed to be imported on both the client and server the export of a single\ndefault function.  We must also use it to wire up the TAO so that should be imported as well:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core':\nimport taoSocketIO from '@tao.js/socket.io';\n\nOR\nconst TAO = require('@tao.js/core');\nconst taoSocketIO = require('@tao.js/socket.io');\n\nSetting it up Server-Side\n@tao.js/socket.io exports a single function as the default which is used on both the server and\nclient to wire up the TAO to Socket.io called wireTaoJsToSocketIO (it helps to be explicit )\nTo wire it up on the server, we must get a reference to an instantiated Server that we get\nfrom calling Socket.io's IO(…) default function or the new Server constructor.  If you're\nunfamiliar with this, please check out the tutorials at Socket.io\nto learn how this works.  We then pass the Socket.io Server and the TAO to the wiring function\nwhich will return a TAO Kernel (separated TAO) that will be mirroring all of the Application\nContexts of the client.\nConnecting the TAO on the Server\nOn the server we need to import the default from the socket.io package along with our imports\nabove:\nimport IO from 'socket.io';\n\nOR\nconst IO = require('socket.io');\n\nDepending on how we set up our server to run and what server-side framework we use for serving\nNode.js Apps, we can then:\nconst io = IO();\ntaoSocketIO(TAO, io, {\n  onConnect: (clientTAO) => {\n    // add handlers for individual client\n    …\n    // optionally return cleanup function on disconnect\n    return () => {\n      // clean up resources when socket is disconnected\n      …\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nOR\nconst server = http.createServer(…); // http or https packages shipped with Node.js\nconst io = IO(server);\ntaoSocketIO(TAO, io, {\n  onConnect: (clientTAO) => {\n    // add handlers for individual client\n    …\n    // optionally return cleanup function on disconnect\n    return () => {\n      // clean up resources when socket is disconnected\n      …\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nWhat's going on above is that the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function is setting a new Namespace\non the Server and adding middleware to it that will proxy Socket.io events to the TAO.\nIn order to keep each client separate from the others, the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function accepts\nas part of its options in the third argument an onConnect callback that will receive a newly\nconstructed TAO Kernel separate from the default global TAO.  This is important in allowing us to\nhandle and chain Application Contexts separately for each client.  Optionally the onConnect\nfunction can itself return a function that will be called when the socket is disconnected in order\nto clean up resources set up within the onConnect function.\nThe global TAO passed into the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function will also have Application Contexts\nproxied to it from the client, and we can use these to react to them in a global way on the Server.\nAt this point we then have everything wired up for our server to leverage the TAO and react to\nApplication Contexts that originate across both execution environments.\nSetting it up Client-side\nFor wiring up the client, we use the same wireTaoJsToSocketIO function exported from\n@tao.js/socket.io that we do on the server.\nJust like on the Server we pass the TAO as the first argument, but unlike on the Server we do not\npass the Socket.io Server in the second argument, rather we pass the Socket.io Client\nthat is available as the global io on the client window.\nConnecting the TAO on the Client\nFirst, we must include the Socket.io Client scripts in our client App by either using the path\nserved by our Socket.io Server or a CDN hosted script:\n\n\nOR\n\n\nThen, we wire up our Socket.io Client to the TAO in our client App:\nconst socket = taoSocketIO(TAO, window.io);\nif (socket) {\n  console.log('connected on socket');\n}\n\nWhat's going on above is that the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function is using window.io to connect\nto the Namespace created for the TAO messages on our back end Socket.io Server.  Once it has\nthe socket, it proxies Application Contexts to and from the TAO to and from the socket in a\nway that ensures those that originate on the client do not mirror and reverberate back for an\ninfinite loop.\nWhy using a Namespace?\nWhile it's beneficial to make the TAO the way (paradigm) to build an App, it's not going to\nforce anyone not to use anything else.  Although Socket.io is the best way to integrate the TAO\nacross server & client, the sockets created can also be used for other things if desired, so it's\neasiest to give the TAO its own space within the socket to operate so it doesn't interfere with\nwhatever else is going on, and more importantly isn't interfered with.\nOptions to wireTaoJsToSocketIO\nThe third argument to wireTaoJsToSocketIO is an opts (options) object that can be used to\ncustomize the behavior of our Sockets used to bridge the TAO across client & server.  Not each\none is relevant to both server and client, so the distinction will be made for each.\nThese options are:\n\nnamespace: string or ns: string - override the default namespace used when connecting\nsockets for the TAO.this must be the same for both server and client in order to work\nonConnect: function (server only) - callback used to get a reference to a TAO Kernel created\nfor each client that connects.  Ignored on the client.\nthis is important to ensure handlers for Application Contexts are not shared across all clients\nconnected to our server for all Application Contexts\nreturn: function (optional) - optionally the function passed in as the onConnect option\ncan return a function that will be called when the socket is disconnected (there is a\n'disconnect' event)\ndepending on your use case, this is not required.  If onConnect is not included, then a separate TAO Kernel is not created for each client\n\n\nhost: string (client only) - by default, Socket.io will connect to the same server that served\nthe client App that is executing in the browser (using the page's origin url).  host allows us\nto connect to a different back-end server.  When doing this, you will need to ensure you've\nenabled CORS on your back-end server.  Ignored on server.\n\nMore about onConnect\nFirst, when integrating with Socket.io, using the onConnect option to get an individual TAO\nper connection (socket) isn't required.  If our App doesn't do anything that is particular to a\nUser's session in the App, and All AppCons are Global then this is unnecessary.\nWith that statement out of the way, this is HIGHLY UNLIKELY when building our App, so it's\nimportant to understand why this provided.\nLet's use an example to illustrate: from the examples in the Basics of Defining Handlers:\nUse Case: User Edits Space\nA TAO-Path that represents when a user edits the details of a Space:\n\n\n\n#\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nUser hits edit\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>\nget the Space Edit form and put it in the UI\n\n\n1\nUser hits cancel\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ngo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n2\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nget the updated Space data and send it to the api\n\n\n3\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n5\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ngo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nTAO-Path without TAO Kernel per Client\nIf we implemented the above using the TAO on the server, we would likely have handlers on the\nserver that are called on the trigrams as follows:\n\n\n\n#\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n2\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nreceive updated Space data\n\n\n3\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n5\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ngo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nThis is all fine and works well enough on its own, but what happens if there is more than one\nclient attached to the server?\nThe {Space,Update,Portal} will only be set once (what we want), but after both {Space,Store,*}\nApplication Contexts are set, they chain to the {Space,Enter,Portal} Application Context.\nThis would get proxied to all clients and set the Application Context to {Space,Enter,Portal}\nfor all of them.  While this would seem normal to the initiator client, this would be very\nstrange for all other clients.\nUsing a TAO Kernel per Client\nWhen the callback onConnect is called, it is due to the 'connect' event on our Socket.io\nServer.  This can happen any time and for the same Socket.io Client over and over.\nBecause of this, anytime a Socket.io Client disconnects, @tao.js/socket.io will attempt to\nremove the client's specific TAO Kernel.  The onConnect function we provide can also return\na Function that @tao.js/socket.io will use to clean up when the socket disconnects.\nThis interface allows us to prevent memory leaks and calling functions on sockets or TAO Kernels\nthat no longer exist in a simpler model to work with clients that can connect and disconnect at\nany time with no guarantees of reconnecting.\nThus the interface allows us to program our onConnect handler as if it's the first time every time.\nTAO-Path with TAO Kernel per Client\nLet's extend our example from above into code for when we use the onConnect method to implement\nthe desired behavior:\nconst io = IO();\ntaoSocketIO(TAO, io, {\n  onConnect: (clientTAO) => {\n    clientTAO\n      .addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n        // validate user authorization to perform Update on this Space\n      })\n      .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n        // chain to storing the updates in Admin db\n        return new AppCtx('Space', 'Store', 'Admin', data);\n      })\n      .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Store', o: 'Admin' }, async (tao, data) => {\n        const { Space, Update } = data;\n        try {\n          const result = await adminDb.spaces.save(Object.assign({}, Space, Update));\n          if (!result || !result.ok) {\n            return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Admin', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: 'result not ok' });\n          }\n          // success => chain to storing the updates to the Portal db (or cache)\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Store', 'Portal', Space, Update, data.Portal);\n        }\n        catch (saveErr) {\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Admin', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: saveErr });\n        }\n      })\n      .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Store', o: 'Portal' }, async (tao, data) => {\n        const { Space, Update, Portal } = data;\n        try {\n          const updatedSpace = Object.assign({}, Space, Update);\n          const result = await portalDb.spaces.save(updatedSpace);\n          if (!result || !result.ok) {\n            return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Portal', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: 'result not ok' });\n          }\n          // success => chain to sending the user back into the individual Space in the Portal\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Enter', 'Portal', updatedSpace, null, data.Portal);\n        }\n        catch (saveErr) {\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Portal', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: saveErr });\n        }\n      });\n  }\n});\n\nIn the above, we are only handling the TAO-Path on the server for the TAO Kernel that is mirroring\nthe client for us, and no other clients will be affected by the interaction.\nonConnect Return Value\nAs mentioned above several times,\nwe can return a Function from our onConnect function.  This function will be called by\n@tao.js/socket.io on the server when our client Socket disconnects (there is a\n'disconnect' event).\nThe purpose of this function is to give us the opportunity to clean up any resources we are using\nfor the specific client socket connection.\nWe'll see an example of it below when using the global TAO to send AppCons back to the client.\nWhat about global TAO?\nNow that we understand how to implement client-specific handlers for Application Contexts, what is\nthe use of the global TAO on the server?\nFirst, when using @tao.js/socket.io to wire up each socket per client connected to our\nSocket.io Server, beyond creating a TAO Kernel per client (when the onConnect callback option\nis used), the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function is also ensuring all Application Context traffic is\nbeing set on the global TAO.\nThis becomes useful to allow our server to react to Application Contexts in a global fashion.\nFor a simple example, let's say we want to keep a simple counter for how many current users are\nviewing each individual Space.

On a server, if a resource\nis requested that does not exist, according to the HTTP Protocol, the server returns a\n404 NOT FOUND.  However, within an SPA, if a resource does not exist, what should we do?\nIn my opinion the better user experience is not to take the user to a page that doesn't exist, but\nfor the application to react accordingly when a resource requested does not exist.\nFrom that standpoint, the URL in the SPA is the reflection of the current context of the application,\nand the user should only get there in the successful (or \"happy\") path.\nAdd/Remove TAO Trigram to/from Route\nThe first and most used interaction is to configure our Router to react to trigrams signaled in the TAO so the URL of our application is updated to reflect the current application context.\nThe API is described below, but the concept is that we are Adding the Route to our app so that\nit will react to a TAO trigram when an Application Context is signaled that matches the trigram.\n@tao.js/router supports and encourages usage of Wildcard trigrams\nso that the term, action or orientation can be serialized into the route itself, meaning we\ncan have fewer actual routes to configure in our app.\nIf modules are loaded dynamically during the execution of the App, Routes can be dynamically\nadded and removed from the router.\nBecause @tao.js espouses the UI to react to Application Contexts signaled in the TAO (using\nlibraries like @tao.js/react), we are not reliant on the URL to tell the App\nwhat UI views or components should be mounted and visible in the App.  What we need then is the\nrouter to reflect what is happening in the App to make it a specific context a user can share\nor rejoin at any point.\nAttach/Detach TAO trigram to/from Route\nThe second interaction relates to triggering an initial context when a user comes to the App for\nthe first time.(We'll discuss browser back & forward later below)\nWhen a user comes to the app, we need to signal to the TAO what application context is set based\non the incoming route of the user to the app.\nTo do this, we use Attach to tell the Router which trigram to use to signal the TAO which\nApplication Context we want triggered based on the incoming route.\nWhy isn't this the same as the TAO Trigram Added to the Route?\nFirst, it can be.  There's nothing in the Router preventing this, and you can pass the attach\noption to the Add call that will signal to the Router to attach the same trigram configuration\nto the Route so you won't have to make 2 explicit calls.\nHowever, the philosophy of building applications with the TAO is to break up your application into\nmore granular Application Contexts (as trigrams) so that we have finer grained handlers that only\nhave one responsibility as well as more points to inject new behaviors down the road.\nWhen building your TAO-based application like this , it's advantageous to split up the\nAdd vs Attach so that the same Route can be used:\n\nas the result of a successful chain of Application Contexts (the trigram Added to the Route)OR\nto initiate the same chain of Application Contexts (the trigram Attached to the Route) to kick off a chain of Application Contexts (via\nAttach) when the user first comes to the app and also be a reaction to an ending Application Context (via Add) once the user is interacting with our app as an SPA signaling ACs as they go.\n\n"},"network-utils/":{"url":"network-utils/","title":"Network Utilities","keywords":"","body":""},"network-utils/functions.html":{"url":"network-utils/functions.html","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Network Utility Functions\ntrigramFilter\nuse the trigramFilter function to create a function that will act as a filter on a trigram.\nseive\nUse the seive to get AppCons from one Network into another.\n"},"network-utils/channel.html":{"url":"network-utils/channel.html","title":"Channel","keywords":"","body":""},"network-utils/transponder.html":{"url":"network-utils/transponder.html","title":"Transponder","keywords":"","body":""},"network-utils/transceiver.html":{"url":"network-utils/transceiver.html","title":"Transceiver","keywords":"","body":""},"network-utils/source.html":{"url":"network-utils/source.html","title":"Source","keywords":"","body":""},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"API Reference","keywords":"","body":"API Documentation\nTODO: migrate this to jsdocs\n\n@tao.js/core\nTAO\nKernel\nAppCon\n\n\n@tao.js/react\nProvider\nReactor\n\n\n@tao.js/socket.io\nwireTaoJsToSocketIO\n\n\n\n"},"api/core/":{"url":"api/core/","title":"@tao.js/core","keywords":"","body":"@tao.js/core package API\nThe public API for the @tao.js/core package exposes the following:\n\nTAO - default export\nKernel - named export\nAppCon - named export\n\n"},"api/core/tao.html":{"url":"api/core/tao.html","title":"TAO","keywords":"","body":"TAO API\nPackage: @tao.js/core\nDefault Export\nDescription\nThe default export of the @tao.js/core package, TAO is a Kernel and therefore\nimplements the API provided.\n"},"api/core/kernel.html":{"url":"api/core/kernel.html","title":"Kernel","keywords":"","body":"Kernel API\nPackage: @tao.js/core\nNamed Export: Kernel\nThe Kernel is the base entry point of execution for tao.js apps.

be the child of the RenderHandler which will have the same\nbehavior as a TAO handler in that it will be called only when an AppCon matching the trigram(s)\ndefined using the trigram props (above) has been set on the TAO Kernel from\nthe closest ancestor Provider.\nThis means that the RenderHandler's children will only be added to the component tree once a\ndesired AppCon has been set in the TAO.\nThis also means that once the RenderHandler's child handler function has been called and the\nreturn has been added to the component tree, they will remain until either:\n\nthe RenderHandler is unmounted\nOR\nanother matching AppCon is set on the TAO triggering a call the handler child function\n\nThis leads to RenderHandler children remaining in the component tree while other non-matching\nAppCons are set on the TAO.\nshouldRender override\nThe default behavior of a RenderHandler not rendering its children to the component tree can be\noverridden by setting the shouldRender prop to true.\nExample\nIt's advisable but not required to create regular React Components as would be normal for any other\nReact app, and wrap those components using RenderHandlers to pass data and decide when they should\nbe added to the render tree.\nTaken from the React Integration Guide, below we are exporting a\ncomponent from an index.js file as a container that wraps the

data prop of the wrapped Component can be set by the handler using 2 methods:\n\nthe return value of the handler function is merged with the existing value\nthe value passed to the set function (3rd arg to the handler) within the handler function\n\nTo ensure deterministic behavior, if the set function is called, the return value of the handler\nfunction will not be merged with the existing value.\nChaining\nThe handler function of the withContext HOC has the ability as any other hander to chain to\nanother AppCon by returning an AppCon from the function.\nIf an AppCon is returned from the handler function, it will not be merged with the existing\nvalue of the data prop.\nTo chain using an AppCon as well as change the value of the data prop of the wrapped\nComponent, use the set function (3rd arg to handler) before returning the next chained AppCon.\nSpecial Note to avoid unnecessary React renders\nIf neither the handler returns a value nor the set arg to the handler function is called, this\nwill instruct the HOC that no change has occurred as a result of the AppCon being set on the TAO in\nwhich case the HOC will not trigger a render.\nExamples\nBasic Example\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  …\n);\n\nexport

    return { user: data.User };\n    }\n    return { role: data.Role };\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nexport default UserHOC(UserView);\n\nUsing set function\nconst RolesHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a

function that can be used to set the value of the name key in the shared data\ncontext\ncurrent - the current value of the name key in the shared data context\n\nhandler function prop behaviors\nUnlike a standard TAO Inline Handler function where all return values that are not an\ninstance of an AppCtx used for chaining are ignored, the\nDataHandler's handler function is used to set the value of the name key in the shared data\ncontext, and so provides the following behaviors:\n\nif the set function passed to the handler is called, that will completely set (overwriting\nexisting values) the value of the name key in the shared data context to the value passed to\nset\nif the set function is not called and the return value is not an instance of AppCtx\nfrom @tao.js/core, then the value will be shallow merged with the existing value for the name\nkey in the shared data context\nif the return value from the handler function is an instance of AppCtx from @tao.js/core,\nit will be returned to the TAO and used to set the context on the TAO as an AppCon chain\n*this can be used in conjunction with the set function passed to the handler\n\n\nif the set function is not called and the handler does not return a value, then nothing will\nhappen\n\nIf not provided as a prop to a DataHandler, the default will be a handler that receives the TAO\nAppCon (tao, data) [trigram and data] and return the data arg without manipulation, serving the\nsecond behavior outlined above.\nChildren\nChildren are required\nChildren can be any valid child of a React Component (so anything).\nDescendant RenderHandlers can gain access to the data the DataHandler is\nupdating in the shared data context from the Provider by using the DataHandler's\nname key in the context prop of the RenderHandler.\nExample\nA simple example of a DataHandler being used to set the User in the shared data context with a\nuser key:\n data.User} // \n
