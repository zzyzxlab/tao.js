# tao.js

A new _way_ of developing software with a few stated goals:

1. Use a simplified language that _elicits_ communication between Engineers and Product Managers
1. Leverage that language to build the software
1. Build software with the intent that it will evolve

## Talk Proposal 1AA

**Name:** Jeff Hoffer

**Title:**
We're the same you and me - A new _Way_ to Align Paradigms across Client & Server(less)

**Title:**
Why can't we program the same? Aligning paradigms across Client & Server(less)

**Title:**
3-Dimensional Events FTW - a New _Way_ to Align Paradigms across Client & Server(less)

**Description:**

We all agree that we like Event-driven programming for building Reactive Applications
([Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)), but while it's fully embraced
in several different forms within Client-side development (because it _has_ to be), Server(less)-based
programming is largely stuck in a Request-Response style paradigm.

Additionally, traditional One- and Two-Dimensional Event systems lack the ability to describe
an entire System the way Developers have to with code.

Using a tiny library called `tao.js` that provides a richer Three-Dimensional Event-like descriptor
[as **T**erm **A**ction **O**rient(ation)] to align how all actions within any system are described & fired,
I will demonstrate how we can have everything we want with some amazing additional benefits:

1. Build with an Architecture that is **designed to Evolve**
1. Build your entire system to be composable and decoupled from day `0`
1. Use the best tool for the job, not be locked into any particular framework or database
1. Build Reactive Applications that have common semantics across all execution stacks
  (clients, servers & serverless) so code lives anywhere and everywhere
1. Get Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) (aka cross-cutting) System-wide for free
1. Collaboratively & rapidly describe the software you're going to build with Product members of your team...
1. ...and Translate those descriptions directly into code

I agree to release any and all audio and video recording and broadcast rights to JSConf for publication

## Talk Proposal 1A

**Name:** Jeff Hoffer

**Title One:** A new _Way_ to Align Programming Paradigms across Client & Server(less) with tao.js

**Title Two:** Aligning the programming paradigm between Client & Server(less) with tao.js

**Description:**

We currently classify Front End Programming distinct from Back End Programming because they both
are implemented using differing Paradigms to achieve their goals.

Using a tiny library called `tao.js` across both execution environments creates a Unified Paradigm
across all execution environments centered around building Reactive Applications ([Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org))
that enforce Functional Programming and allow Universal Composability throughout your entire
System of Applications.

I will demonstrate how embracing this _Way_ of programming provides the following benefits:



## Talk Proposal 1B

**Name:** Jeff Hoffer

**Title:** A new _Way_ to build Reactive Systems and Align Code across Clients & Servers with tao.js

**Title Two:** Embrace the _Way_: build Reactive Systems and Align code across Clients & Servers using tao.js

**Description:**

The [Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org) was written in 2013, and yet it hasn't been
fully embraced by the JS Community.  At the same time, we classify Front End Programming separately from
Back End Programming because they both rely on differing programming paradigms.

After spending 20 years designing, building, maintaining and evolving application systems, I can now
use a tiny library called `tao.js` to unify programming paradigms across Client, Server & Serverless
while gaining many additional benefits to all 4 of those activities.

`tao.js` provides a super-powered Event-based reactive programming model using a 3-dimensional
view of Events [as **T**erm **A**ction **O**rient(ation)] with the following benefits:

## Talk Proposal 2

**Name:** Jeff Hoffer

**Title:** Using `tao.js` to change the _Way_ we describe and build applications

**Description:**

Traditional ways of describing software have limitations:

* Use Cases are 2-dimensional - `Order Food`
* User Stories have no direct translation to code
* BDD is extremely verbose
* Basic CRUD Operations aren't rich enough to capture business logic coordination

`tao.js` (derived from **T**erm **A**ction **O**rient(ation)) uses a 3-dimensional
event-driven model to overcome these limitations and translate the application description
directly to code.

~~Traditional ways of describing applications limit themselves to a 2-dimensional reference like
User.goesToTheBathroom.  `tao.js` [derived from **T**erm **A**ction **O**rient(ation)] uses a
3-dimensional event-driven model~~

In this talk I'll show you how to use `tao.js` to:

1. Collaboratively & rapidly describe the software you're going to build with Product members of your team
1. Translate those descriptions directly into code
1. Build your entire system to be composable and decoupled from day `0`
1. Use the best tool for the job, not be locked into any particular framework
1. Build Reactive applications ([Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org)) that have common
  semantics across all execution stacks (clients, servers & serverless) so code lives anywhere and everywhere
1. Get Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) (aka cross-cutting) for free

## Talk Proposal 3

Title: A new Way to communicate and build applications using `tao.js`

Description:
Almost a decade ago I was stuck with a problem:
> how do I explain to a set of engineers the various aspects of an Application we were building
> while being exhaustive in not missing anything but at the same time not having to define everything
> myself up front?

That's when I realized a traditional 2-dimensional matrix (Entity x Function) wasn't enough to capture all of the requirements.
By adding a 3rd dimension (Perspective) I was able to effectively communicate the concepts to the team as well as allow
them to see where they had gaps they needed to fill in.

Once I realized what I had, I wondered if it would be possible to translate this way of defining an Application into
actual code.  Thus is born `tao.js` - a frameworkless library used to build applications designed to be composable and
evolve.  However `tao.js` isn't just a philosophical name for a library but a pnuemonic to remember on how things are defined:

**T**erm
**A**ction
**O**rient(ation)
