## Title

Solve Technical Debt by Decoupling Apps from Architecture

## Abstract

Every App no matter how carefully crafted at the outset incurs Technical Debt.  Our choice then
becomes to solve it early with a lot of upfront architectural work or solve it later by moving
quickly on the Application itself.  I say, "why choose?"

By leveraging proven architectural principles, tao.js was built to provide a simplified way of
Decoupling our Apps from the Architecture on which they reside to allow each to evolve as
necessary and only when needed.  In this talk you will learn Why it works with onstage live
coding of converting an existing application to use tao.js, and then evolve the App's
architecture easily without affecting the App's functionality.

## More Details

The kernel of the idea for what has become tao.js occurred to me 10 years ago when I was involved in a rewrite of an existing application.  As I fielded questions from my team about how to list and prioritize UI designs, I realized that breaking the application up into a 3-dimensional matrix (subject, activity, perspective) not only made for a compact way to communicate the list, it allowed the team to continue generating more on their own.  More importantly, it also provided a much richer way to model an application.

By combining this triple-based approach through trigrams with a message-oriented flow-based programming model, I developed a way to build applications that are designed at the start to evolve easily with dynamic interfaces that are natural extension points.  In order to provide control over the flow, I devised a simplified model for prioritizing messages using 3 basic primitives (intercept, async and inline).

After a failed attempt to build it in C# with its strict typing and structure, it was making a second attempt in JavaScript and the freedom it provides that unlocked the potential for me (I love this language).  I also figured out that calling it tao.js (for Term, Action, Orientation) was so much more fitting since it provides a _way_ to build Applications and it's easier to remember the parts of the trigram.

At that point I had my model for how to build apps this way and a working start to a library, but I struggled with explaining why it was important or useful to other developers.  There are so many benefits to building apps this way, but when I would get into it, I'd be so passionate about all of those benefits that I'd be all over the place.  They would see some of the benefits based on the kind of programming they did most often, but it was still just a curiosity.

I realized I had to find a way to articulate the true value of building applications in this way that developers of all kinds could grok quickly.  My persistence paid off when I started working full-time as a Software Architect for a Chief Architect, and I was trying to think of how I could explain it to him.  I thought about how Docker was able to use Containerization Technology to decouple the Application from its Infrastructure, and I realized that tao.js was allowing the same decoupling to occur between an App and its Architecture.

This is definitely a passion project for me and something I want to see in the world simply to improve the way we build applications.  I've spent a 20+ year career building software, always focused on how to do it better, faster and more efficiently.  Inspired by elegant
designs of algorithms, systems and usability, I want to inspire people to build software in a better way.

As my first career boss said to me: "why focus on design patterns when all software moves towards entropy?"  I actually can't argue with the point, but instead I want to embrace it and accept the inevitable entropy in my software and build in a way that works with it.  tao.js is my contribution to that cause.

## Personal Details

tao.js documentation available at https://tao.js.org

I am personally very excited to be considered to speak at JSConf Budapest.  As a kid growing up, I was fortunate enough to get to know and spend time with my great-grandparents who emigrated to New York City at the turn of the 19th century from Hungary.  As a child we always ate Hungarian food and attended Hungarian Festivals which are now both very hard to find in Los Angeles.  It is the heritage with which I am most closely affiliated and proud because of this and would fulfill a lifelong dream of mine to visit Hungary.

# A bit about you

I have been working on this solution for a decade while I've built high scale Internet applications as well as commercial enterprise products that must also scale.  I am now embarking on sharing this with the engineering community abroad starting with the JavaScript community for which I've built the first implementation.
