## More to come

This really needs to be filled out

## Getting started with this repo

The repo is designed to use `nvm` and `npm`/`npx` so that nothing is expected to be installed globally.
Additionally, to run the examples you should have Docker installed locally as well.

In the root of the repo:

```sh
$ nvm install
$ npm install
$ npx lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

### Running example site and api

The Example work are the folders inside the [`examples`] directory. To run them:

```sh
# in repo root dir
$ docker-compose up -d
# once db is running
$ cd examples/patois.api
$ npm start
$ cd ../patois.web
$ yarn start
```

## Contributing - REALLY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses `commitizen` and `lerna` + some githooks for `prettier` and `jest` to run.

When you have made some changes and staged them **do not** use `git commit` but instead use:

```sh
$ npx git cz
```

Which will start `commitizen` for you to generate the commit message in the desired conventional changelog format.

## To Dos

- [x] bootstrapping
  - [x] add test coverage reporting
- [x] complete `@tao.js/core` package
  - [x] refactor the `tao` API for consistency - e.g. replace external references to `term` => `t`, `action` => `a`, `orient` => `o`
  - [x] write unit tests
    - [x] adding inline handler unit tests
    - [x] adding async handler unit tests
    - [x] adding intercept handler unit tests
    - [x] removing inline handler unit tests
    - [x] removing async handler unit tests
    - [x] removing intercept handler unit tests
    - [x] using `asPromiseHook`
  - [x] refactor intercept handler to `await` like inline handler calls do to match guarantee provided in docs
- [x] complete initial `@tao.js/react` package

  - [x] implement `SwitchHandler` that works like `Reactor` to choose which direct child `RenderHandler`s to display
        based on signaled ACs - turns off/removes `RenderHandler`s like `Adapter` unlike standalone `RenderHandler`
  - [x] implement `DataHandler` that supplies data as a `React.Provider` to `RenderHandler` consumers below
        from data passed into it's `handler`
  - [x] refactor `DataHandler` logic for its context into `createContextHandler` for reuse and expose for public use
